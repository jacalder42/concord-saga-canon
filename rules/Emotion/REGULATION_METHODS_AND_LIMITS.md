## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines **how emotional regulation works operationally**.

It exists to:
- distinguish regulation from suppression
- prevent “calm as power” misuse
- define what actually lowers risk
- support believable recovery without erasure

Regulation manages emotion.
It does not eliminate it.

---

## 2. REGULATION VS SUPPRESSION

### Regulation
- acknowledges emotion
- allows safe expression
- reduces volatility
- lowers escalation risk
- requires effort and presence

### Suppression
- denies emotion
- stores pressure
- delays failure
- increases blast radius
- appears calm but is unstable

Suppression always fails.
The only question is when.

## 3. VALID REGULATION METHODS (NON-MYSTICAL)

Regulation must be **human-scale** and **effortful**.

Valid methods include:

- breath control
- physical grounding (touch, posture)
- humor (deflection, reframing)
- ritual (routine, repetition)
- music or rhythm
- shared attention
- presence without solution
- naming emotion aloud

No method works instantly.
All require time.

---

## 4. REGULATION IS CONTEXTUAL

What works depends on:
- environment
- emotional state
- relationship safety
- fatigue level
- time available

A method that works once may fail later.

There are no universal fixes.

---

## 5. LIMITS OF REGULATION

Regulation cannot:
- erase grief
- negate loss
- bypass cost
- restore depleted reserves instantly
- prevent all failure

Regulation reduces risk.
It does not guarantee success.

---

## 6. REGULATION UNDER PRESSURE

Under high pressure:
- regulation is harder
- effort cost increases
- effectiveness decreases

Attempting regulation too late often fails.

Early regulation matters.

---

## 7. REGULATION & MECHANICA

Effective regulation:
- lowers volatility
- slightly reduces UARS cost
- widens safe action windows

Poor regulation:
- increases misalignment risk
- worsens failure outcomes

Regulation never eliminates cost.
It reshapes it.

---

## 8. ERA DRIFT IN REGULATION

### Veil
- regulation undervalued
- suppression institutionalized
- private coping only

### Neon
- visible regulation attempts
- public failure common
- mixed effectiveness

### Loom
- regulation scarce
- exhaustion dominant
- small successes matter

### Post-Mending
- regulation culturally normalized
- shared practices increase
- limits remain

---

## 9. FAILED REGULATION PATTERNS (FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS)

- forced calm
- moral shaming
- emotional bypass (“it’s fine”)
- authority-imposed silence
- distraction-as-solution

These increase instability.

---

## 10. CANON GUARDRAILS

If regulation:
- works instantly
- restores full capacity
- replaces consequence
- appears effortless

The scene violates canon.

## 11. INTEGRATION NOTES

This system integrates with:
- Emotional Load & Fatigue
- Emotional Modes & Instability
- Resonance Escalation Logic
- Symbol System (green/halo motifs)

## 12. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Optional: add character-specific regulation styles
- [ ] Optional: add failed-regulation vignette examples
