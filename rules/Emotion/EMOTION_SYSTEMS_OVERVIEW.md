# EMOTION SYSTEMS — OVERVIEW
Status: Authoritative Canon
Source: Project Memory + Mechanica v4 + Resonance v1
Phase: Phase 1A Migration
Applies To: Veil, Neon, Loom, Post-Mending

## 1. PURPOSE

The Emotion Systems define **how emotion functions operationally** in the Concord Saga.

This system exists to:
- prevent emotions from becoming superpowers
- define how emotion interacts with resonance and cost
- support consistent character behavior under pressure
- enforce emotional realism at scale

Emotion is not magic.
Emotion is fuel, friction, and signal.

---

## 2. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SYSTEMS

- **Mechanica v4** defines cost, escalation, and failure.
- **Resonance System** defines emotional physics behavior.
- **Emotion Systems** define *how humans experience and manage emotion* within those constraints.

Emotion answers:
- *What state is the character in?*
- *What risk profile does that create?*

---

## 3. CORE RULE: EMOTION ≠ POWER

Emotion:
- increases intensity
- increases instability
- increases cost

Emotion does not:
- grant abilities
- guarantee outcomes
- override consequence

High emotion makes things harder, not easier.

---

## 4. EMOTION AS SIGNAL

Emotion functions as:
- an internal signal (what is happening)
- an external signal (what others can sense)
- a regulatory load (what must be managed)

Ignored emotion always reappears as failure.

---

## 5. EMOTION & INTENT

Emotion without Intent:
- destabilizes
- fragments
- escalates unpredictably

Intent without emotion:
- collapses
- loses traction
- fails to move systems

Stable action requires both.

---

## 6. EMOTIONAL LOAD

Every character carries an **emotional load**:
- unresolved fear
- grief
- attachment
- anger
- exhaustion

Load accumulates over time.
Load increases UARS cost.
Load affects failure modes.

No character is emotionally “fresh” under pressure.

---

## 7. EMOTIONAL REGULATION (NON-MYSTICAL)

Regulation includes:
- breath
- touch
- humor
- ritual
- music
- presence
- shared attention

Regulation:
- reduces volatility
- does not remove cost
- requires effort and time

Forced calm is suppression.

---

## 8. EMOTION & ESCALATION

Escalation occurs when:
- emotion intensifies
- regulation fails
- suppression stores pressure
- context amplifies load

Escalation is always traceable.

---

## 9. ERA DRIFT (HIGH LEVEL)

### Veil
- emotional suppression normalized
- delayed failures
- institutional denial

### Neon
- emotional volatility visible
- public overload
- frequent misregulation

### Loom
- exhaustion dominant
- grief saturation
- burnout systemic

### Post-Mending
- emotional literacy improves
- regulation more common
- pain remains personal, not catastrophic

---

## 10. CANON GUARDRAILS

Emotion systems must never:
- replace decision-making
- excuse harm
- function as destiny
- be aestheticized without consequence

If emotion feels empowering without cost, the scene is wrong.

---

## 11. INTEGRATION NOTES

This system integrates with:
- Emotional Modes & Instability (Resonance)
- UARS cost escalation (Mechanica)
- Symbol expression (color, sound, geometry)
- Channel perception limits (MT / VT / LT)

---

## 12. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Expand emotional load & fatigue rules
- [ ] Expand regulation methods by context
- [ ] Expand failure signatures tied to emotion
