## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines how **emotional load accumulates over time** and how that load produces fatigue, burnout, and delayed failure.

It exists to:
- prevent characters from “resetting” emotionally
- enforce cumulative consequence
- support long-arc realism
- align emotion with UARS cost escalation

Emotion is not spent and refreshed.
It is carried.

---

## 2. WHAT EMOTIONAL LOAD IS

Emotional load is the **sum of unresolved emotional states** a character carries.

Load may include:
- fear not processed
- grief deferred
- anger suppressed
- attachment under threat
- moral injury
- exhaustion

Load is invisible until it isn’t.

---

## 3. LOAD ACCUMULATION

Emotional load increases when:
- intense emotion is not regulated
- suppression is used instead of processing
- repeated crises occur without recovery
- responsibility exceeds capacity
- grief is postponed “until later”

Load accumulates silently during success.

---

## 4. LOAD DOES NOT DISSIPATE ON ITS OWN

Time alone does not remove load.

Load decreases only through:
- regulation
- acknowledgment
- rest
- support
- grief expression

Ignoring load increases eventual cost.

---

## 5. FATIGUE STATES

As load accumulates, characters enter fatigue states.

### 5.1 LOW FATIGUE
- irritability
- reduced patience
- subtle judgment errors

### 5.2 MODERATE FATIGUE
- narrowed focus
- increased emotional reactivity
- reduced regulation capacity

### 5.3 SEVERE FATIGUE (BURNOUT)
- dissociation
- shutdown
- panic collapse
- reckless escalation

Burnout is not weakness.
It is system overload.

---

## 6. DELAYED FAILURE PRINCIPLE

Emotional failure is often **delayed**.

A character may:
- succeed in the moment
- function under pressure
- “hold it together”

…and fail later, when the load comes due.

Delayed failure is canon-correct and expected.

---

## 7. INTERACTION WITH MECHANICA (UARS)

Emotional load:
- increases UARS cost
- narrows safe action windows
- worsens failure outcomes

High load + high boost = catastrophic failure risk.

No exception.

---

## 8. ERA DRIFT IN FATIGUE

### Veil
- suppression common
- failure delayed and hidden

### Neon
- volatility visible
- burnout frequent

### Loom
- exhaustion systemic
- grief saturation
- collapse common

### Post-Mending
- load still exists
- catastrophic failure dampened
- burnout remains personal, not world-breaking

---

## 9. RECOVERY IS NOT RESET

Recovery:
- lowers load incrementally
- does not erase history
- requires time and effort

Characters do not return to baseline.
They adapt or carry scars.

---

## 10. CANON GUARDRAILS

If a character:
- endures endless crisis without fatigue
- performs peak actions while emotionally depleted
- suffers no delayed consequence

The scene violates canon.

---

## 11. INTEGRATION NOTES

This system integrates with:
- Mechanica v4 (UARS escalation)
- Emotional Modes & Instability
- Resonance Escalation Logic
- Symbol System (fatigue expression cues)

---

## 12. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Optional: add fatigue tells by POV character
- [ ] Optional: add civic vs frontline fatigue contrast
