## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines how **humor and relief function as emotional regulation** in the Concord Saga.

It exists to:
- prevent tonal collapse (especially in Loom)
- define humor as effortful regulation, not deflection
- protect against quip-shielding and irony armor
- ensure relief moments serve character and system health

Humor is not levity.
Humor is pressure management.

---

## 2. CORE RULE: HUMOR ≠ DISMISSAL

Humor must:
- acknowledge pressure
- coexist with stakes
- leave consequences intact

Humor must not:
- erase danger
- trivialize harm
- override grief
- function as emotional anesthesia

If humor makes consequences disappear, it is non-canon.

---

## 3. HUMOR AS REGULATION

Humor is a **valid regulation method** when it:
- reframes perspective
- releases tension briefly
- restores human connection
- creates emotional breathing room

Humor does **not**:
- reduce cost
- remove fatigue
- prevent failure permanently

It lowers volatility, not weight.

## 4. TYPES OF CANON-COMPLIANT HUMOR

### 4.1 GROUNDING HUMOR
- quiet wit
- shared observation
- situational irony

**Function**
- stabilizes nervous system
- restores presence
- supports regulation

---

### 4.2 RELATIONAL HUMOR
- teasing with trust
- affectionate sarcasm
- shared language

**Function**
- reinforces bonds
- improves coordination
- reduces isolation

Requires relationship safety.

---

### 4.3 GALLLOWS HUMOR (LIMITED)

- used under extreme pressure
- brief and sharp
- followed by silence or cost

**Function**
- momentary survival mechanism

Overuse leads to dissociation.

---

### 4.4 SELF-AWARE HUMOR

- acknowledgment of absurdity
- recognition of limits
- refusal of false heroics

**Function**
- prevents reckless escalation
- counters certainty narratives

---

## 5. FORBIDDEN HUMOR PATTERNS

These are **explicitly non-canon**:

- quips during active catastrophe
- humor that humiliates pain
- irony that blocks vulnerability
- sarcasm used to dominate
- jokes that replace decision-making

Humor cannot be a weapon.

---

## 6. HUMOR UNDER PRESSURE

As pressure increases:
- humor becomes harder
- timing narrows
- failure risk increases

Poorly timed humor:
- escalates misalignment
- worsens fatigue
- damages trust

Good humor under pressure is rare and costly.

---

## 7. ERA DRIFT IN HUMOR

### Veil
- restrained
- private
- often suppressed

### Neon
- sharper
- more public
- sometimes destabilizing

### Loom
- scarce
- precious
- often quiet and brief

### Post-Mending
- more frequent
- gentler
- still bounded by context

In Loom, one genuine relief moment can carry an entire act.

---

## 8. HUMOR & SYMBOL EXPRESSION

Humor correlates with:
- softened geometry
- brief green or warm tones
- lowered sound intensity

Humor does not produce spectacle.
It produces **space**.

---

## 9. HUMOR & FAILURE MODES

Humor can:
- interrupt panic
- slow reckless escalation
- delay burnout

Humor cannot:
- stop collapse alone
- heal trauma instantly
- replace regulation work

Humor fails when used as avoidance.

---

## 10. CANON GUARDRAILS

If humor:
- removes fear
- cancels grief
- restores full capacity
- appears effortless

The scene violates canon.

---

## 11. INTEGRATION NOTES

- Regulation Methods & Limits
- Emotional Load & Fatigue
- Emotion-Driven Failure Modes
- Symbol System (green/halo softening)
- Fun Layer (as controlled expression)
