## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines **how emotional systems fail** when load exceeds regulation capacity.

It exists to:
- prevent random or arbitrary breakdowns
- make failure legible and causal
- align emotional collapse with Mechanica failure
- support believable character consequences

Failure is not moral.
It is mechanical and human.

---

## 2. FAILURE IS A PROCESS

Emotional failure:
- escalates over time
- follows warning signs
- worsens if ignored
- often appears after apparent success

Sudden collapse without buildup violates canon.

---

## 3. PRIMARY FAILURE MODES

### 3.1 PANIC CASCADE

**Trigger**
- acute fear
- rapid uncertainty
- crowd amplification

**Behavior**
- narrowed perception
- impulsive action
- loss of fine control

**Consequences**
- reckless escalation
- collateral damage
- shard precursor conditions

Panic accelerates cost faster than any other mode.

---

### 3.2 DISSOCIATION

**Trigger**
- prolonged overload
- unresolved trauma
- emotional saturation

**Behavior**
- emotional detachment
- slowed response
- fragmented perception

**Consequences**
- delayed reaction
- missed warnings
- structural failure later

Dissociation looks calm.
It is not.

---

### 3.3 SHUTDOWN

**Trigger**
- severe fatigue
- sustained suppression
- burnout threshold crossed

**Behavior**
- emotional numbing
- withdrawal
- reduced agency

**Consequences**
- inability to act
- loss of leadership
- increased danger to others

Shutdown is not rest.
It is collapse.

---

### 3.4 RECKLESS ESCALATION

**Trigger**
- anger combined with fatigue
- grief redirected as action
- desperation for resolution

**Behavior**
- overcommitment
- excessive boosts
- boundary violations

**Consequences**
- catastrophic UARS cost
- irreversible harm
- personal injury or death

This mode feels “heroic.”
It is lethal.

---

### 3.5 MISALIGNMENT

**Trigger**
- emotion contradicts intent
- action taken against internal state
- forced composure

**Behavior**
- erratic execution
- symbolic distortion
- VT precision loss

**Consequences**
- failure amplification
- relational damage
- system backlash

Misalignment is the most subtle failure.
It is also the most dangerous.

---

## 4. COMPOUND FAILURE

Failure modes stack.

Common progressions:
- panic → reckless escalation
- dissociation → delayed collapse
- misalignment → shard formation
- shutdown → external catastrophe

Once stacked, recovery is difficult and costly.

---

## 5. FAILURE & SYMBOL EXPRESSION

Failure expresses through:
- geometry collapse
- strobe or blackout
- sound dropout
- color desaturation or overload

Symbol failure should precede plot failure.

---

## 6. ERA DRIFT IN FAILURE

### Veil
- failure hidden
- delayed consequences
- private collapse

### Neon
- visible breakdowns
- public escalation
- social amplification

### Loom
- exhaustion-driven collapse
- mass failure
- irreversible loss

### Post-Mending
- failures remain
- damage contained
- consequences personal

---

## 7. RECOVERY AFTER FAILURE

Recovery requires:
- acknowledgment
- time
- support
- regulation

Failure leaves scars.
It does not reset characters.

---

## 8. CANON GUARDRAILS

If failure:
- resolves instantly
- produces no cost
- improves capability
- is narratively rewarded

The scene violates canon.

---

## 9. INTEGRATION NOTES

This system integrates with:
- Emotional Load & Fatigue
- Regulation Methods & Limits
- Resonance Escalation Logic
- Symbol System failure cues
- Mechanica v4 UARS consequences

## 10. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Optional: add POV-specific failure tells
- [ ] Optional: add civic-scale failure examples
