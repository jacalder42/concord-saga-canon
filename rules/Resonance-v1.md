Phase: Phase 1A Migration
Aligned With: Mechanica v4
Applies To: Veil, Neon, Loom, Post-Mending

## 1. WHAT RESONANCE IS

Resonance is **emotional physics**.

It is the interaction between:
- human emotional states
- collective emotional fields
- environmental structures

Resonance is not:
- magic
- supernatural force
- consciousness
- morality
- destiny

Resonance does not “want.”
It reacts.

---

## 2. CORE PRINCIPLE

Emotion is energy.

When emotion interacts with environment under pressure, **resonance emerges**.

Resonance expresses:
- amplification
- distortion
- instability
- connection
- collapse

It never grants control without cost.

---

## 3. RELATIONSHIP TO MECHANICA

The Resonance System describes:
- how resonance **behaves**
- how it **feels**
- how it **escalates**
- how it **expresses itself sensorially**

Mechanica governs:
- cost
- limits
- escalation permissions
- failure modes

Resonance answers *what happens*.  
Mechanica answers *what it costs*.

---

## 4. WHAT RESONANCE DOES NOT DO

Resonance does not:
- judge
- choose sides
- reward virtue
- punish evil
- replace agency

Resonance magnifies what already exists.

---

## 5. HUMAN SCALE RULE

All resonance behavior remains **human-scale**.

If a phenomenon:
- removes agency
- erases responsibility
- overrides emotion
- functions without cost

…it is not resonance and does not belong in canon.
## 6. EMOTION AS DRIVER

Emotion is the primary driver of resonance.

Different emotional states produce different resonance behaviors.

Emotion does not map to outcome.
It maps to *instability profile*.

---

## 7. PRIMARY EMOTIONAL MODES

### Fear
- Sharp amplification
- Narrow focus
- Increased fracture risk
- Red/orange spectrum

---

### Anger
- Directional force
- Short-term clarity
- Rapid burnout
- High collateral risk

---

### Grief
- Heavy persistence
- Memory imprinting
- Slow-moving distortion
- Indigo spectrum

---

### Love / Connection
- Stabilizing when mutual
- Dangerous when unilateral
- Enables grounding and repair
- Green → white spectrum

---

### Calm
- Dampened amplitude
- Reduced cost
- Enhanced perception
- Rare under pressure

---

### Overload
- Loss of modulation
- Strobe-like behavior
- Precursor to shard events
- Yellow spectrum

---

## 8. MIXED STATES

Most resonance events involve mixed emotional states.

Mixed states:
- increase unpredictability
- complicate containment
- raise failure probability

Clean emotional states are rare and unstable.
## 9. EXPRESSION CHANNELS

Resonance expresses only through:
- Light
- Sound
- Geometry
- Color

No additional channels are permitted.

---

## 10. LIGHT BEHAVIOR

- Soft halos: regulation, empathy
- Flicker: uncertainty, instability
- Strobe: overload, fracture risk
- Bloom: expansion, connection
- Prismatic drift: post-Mending filtration

---

## 11. SOUND BEHAVIOR

- Hum: stability
- Pulse: emotional spike
- Buzz/static: friction or tech interference
- Harmonics: connection or alignment
- Undertone: shard proximity

---

## 12. GEOMETRY BEHAVIOR

- Lines/grids: structure, containment
- Threads/knots: connection, tension
- Fractures: instability
- Spirals: turbulence
- Rings: stabilization
- Prismatic planes: post-Mending only

---

## 13. COLOR CONSTRAINTS

Color expresses emotional pressure, not magic.

Color must always correspond to:
- emotional state
- environment
- pressure level
## 14. ESCALATION TRIGGERS

Resonance escalates when:
- emotion intensifies
- suppression fails
- crowds amplify states
- environment conducts pressure
- cost is ignored

Escalation is never sudden without cause.

---

## 15. CALM → BLOOM

Triggered by:
- emotional openness
- connection
- release after suppression

Bloom is beautiful and dangerous.

---

## 16. BLOOM → SHARD

Triggered by:
- sustained overload
- conflicting emotional vectors
- environmental amplification
- failed containment

Shard formation is a system failure.

---

## 17. SHARD → RUPTURE

Triggered by:
- continued misuse
- panic escalation
- high-conductivity environments
- ignored warning signs

Rupture permanently scars the world.

---

## 18. POST-MENDING LIMIT

After the Mending:
- escalation halts at NODE
- shards cannot form
- rupture is impossible

Pressure still exists.
Catastrophe does not.
## 19. PERCEPTION VARIANCE

Most people:
- do not perceive resonance directly
- notice secondary effects

Examples:
- lights flicker
- sound warps
- emotions feel “thick”
- tech glitches

---

## 20. MISATTRIBUTION

Civilians often interpret resonance as:
- stress
- weather
- infrastructure failure
- mass hysteria

This fuels denial, panic, and exploitation.

---

## 21. ATTUNED PERCEPTION

Some individuals:
- sense pressure earlier
- notice patterns
- feel cost before action

This is sensitivity, not power.
## 22. RESONANCE AND CONTROL

Attempts to:
- suppress emotion
- weaponize resonance
- remove variability

always increase instability.

Control without empathy produces fracture.

---

## 23. WHY SUPPRESSION FAILS

Suppression:
- stores pressure
- delays release
- increases blast radius

This is why authoritarian systems fail under resonance.

---

## 24. WHY WEAPONIZATION FAILS

Weaponization:
- strips Intent
- ignores cost
- treats emotion as resource

This produces:
- shard events
- manufactured meta instability
- systemic collapse

---

## 25. STABILITY PRINCIPLE

Stability emerges from:
- emotional literacy
- shared grounding
- acceptance of cost

Not from silence.
Not from control.
## 26. INTEGRATION WITH MECHANICA

Resonance System:
- Defines behavior and feel

Mechanica v4:
- Enforces limits and cost

Neither replaces the other.

## 27. TODO / VERIFICATION FLAGS

- [ ] Verify any longform examples exist in original drafts
- [ ] Confirm if additional emotional modes were ever canonized
- [ ] Optional: add city-specific resonance dialect appendix
