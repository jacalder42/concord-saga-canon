## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines how **light and sound** function as symbolic signals.

Light and sound are the **most immediate sensory indicators** of resonance pressure.
They provide early warnings before geometry fails.

They do not:
- create power
- replace cost
- override mechanics

They reveal condition.

---

## 2. CORE RULES

- Light and sound respond faster than geometry.
- They escalate before structural failure.
- They must align with emotion, environment, and pressure.
- They are diagnostic, not spectacular.

If light or sound feels impressive without consequence, the scene is incorrect.

---

## 3. LIGHT MOTIFS

### 3.1 HALO — EMPATHY / REGULATION

**Meaning**
- Care
- Grounding
- Emotional regulation

**Behavior**
- Soft
- Diffuse
- Low saturation

**Contexts**
- Mutual connection
- Caretaking
- Stabilization attempts

**Failure Mode**
- Fading
- Fragmentation
- Inability to hold shape

Halos require effort.
They do not persist automatically.

---

### 3.2 FLICKER — UNCERTAINTY / INSTABILITY

**Meaning**
- Early warning
- Emotional inconsistency
- Structural strain

**Behavior**
- Intermittent
- Uneven
- Disruptive

**Contexts**
- Denial
- Suppressed emotion
- Early escalation zones

**Failure Mode**
- Transition to strobe
- Complete blackout

Flicker is never neutral.
It always signals risk.

---

### 3.3 STROBE — OVERLOAD / FRACTURE RISK

**Meaning**
- Loss of modulation
- Imminent failure

**Behavior**
- Harsh
- Rhythmic
- Disorienting

**Contexts**
- Panic
- Crowd escalation
- Pre-shard environments

**Failure Mode**
- Shard formation
- Collapse

Strobe is dangerous.
It should be uncomfortable to read.

---

### 3.4 BLOOM — EXPANSION / RELEASE

**Meaning**
- Emotional opening
- Pressure release

**Behavior**
- Outward growth
- Warmth or intensity increase

**Contexts**
- Confession
- Emotional release
- Connection moments

**Failure Mode**
- Overexpansion
- Loss of containment

Bloom is not safe by default.

---

### 3.5 PRISMATIC DRIFT — POST-MENDING ONLY

**Meaning**
- Filtration
- Clarity
- Stabilized flow

**Behavior**
- Gentle refraction
- No sharp edges
- Low intensity

**Contexts**
- Echo Nodes
- Ascendant perception
- Post-Mending quiet scenes

**Failure Mode**
- None (by design)

If prismatic drift appears pre-Mending, canon is broken.

---

## 4. SOUND MOTIFS

### 4.1 HUM — STABILITY / CONTAINMENT

**Meaning**
- Regulation
- Structural integrity

**Behavior**
- Low
- Continuous
- Grounding

**Contexts**
- Stabilized corridors
- Grounding rituals
- Caretaking scenes

**Failure Mode**
- Dropout
- Pitch instability

Hum disappearing is a warning.

---

### 4.2 PULSE — EMOTIONAL SPIKE

**Meaning**
- Sudden intensity
- Escalation

**Behavior**
- Rhythmic
- Heartbeat-adjacent

**Contexts**
- Fear response
- Decision points
- Action initiation

**Failure Mode**
- Acceleration into strobe
- Irregularity

Pulse indicates rising cost.

---

### 4.3 BUZZ / STATIC — FRICTION / INTERFERENCE

**Meaning**
- Misalignment
- MT interference
- Emotional contradiction

**Behavior**
- Abrasive
- Irregular
- Distracting

**Contexts**
- Tech failure
- Mixed emotional states
- Crowded environments

**Failure Mode**
- Total signal loss
- Feedback loops

Buzz is stress made audible.

---

### 4.4 HARMONICS — ALIGNMENT / CONNECTION

**Meaning**
- Shared Intent
- Emotional alignment

**Behavior**
- Layered
- Musical
- Resonant

**Contexts**
- Successful grounding
- Mutual care
- Stabilization at scale

**Failure Mode**
- Dissonance
- Collapse into noise

Harmonics are rare and fragile.

---

### 4.5 UNDERTONE — SHARD PROXIMITY

**Meaning**
- Deep instability
- Structural threat

**Behavior**
- Barely audible
- Persistent
- Unsettling

**Contexts**
- Shard-laced corridors
- Loom collapse zones

**Failure Mode**
- Transition to rupture-level soundscape

Undertone is danger you feel before you see it.

---

## 5. ERA DRIFT (LIGHT & SOUND)

### Veil
- Minimal light effects
- Sound mostly absent
- Signals easy to miss

### Neon
- Frequent flicker and buzz
- Strobe appears during escalation
- Sound distortion common

### Loom
- Dominant soundscapes
- Environmental noise overwhelms dialogue
- Light often hostile

### Post-Mending
- Quieter environments
- Softer light
- Sound returns to human scale

---

## 6. USAGE CONSTRAINTS

- Use **one light motif OR one sound motif per beat**, not both unless escalation is extreme
- Avoid decorative descriptions
- Let discomfort signal danger

If light and sound feel “cool,” you’ve gone too far.

---

## 7. INTEGRATION NOTES

Light and sound motifs integrate with:
- Geometry Motifs
- Color Semantics
- Resonance Weather
- Corridor Ecology
- Mechanica cost escalation

---

## 8. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Optional: add combined light+sound escalation ladder
- [ ] Optional: add MT vs VT sound contrast notes
