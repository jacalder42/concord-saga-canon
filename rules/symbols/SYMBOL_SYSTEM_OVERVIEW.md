# SYMBOL & MOTIF SYSTEM — OVERVIEW
Status: Authoritative Canon
Source: Project Memory + Mechanica v4 + Resonance v1
Phase: Phase 1A Migration
Applies To: Veil, Neon, Loom, Post-Mending

---

## 1. PURPOSE

The Symbol & Motif System defines the **visual, auditory, and spatial grammar** through which resonance and emotion are expressed.

This system exists to:
- prevent symbolic drift
- constrain spectacle
- ensure symbols reflect mechanics
- unify prose, VFX, art, and tone

Symbols do not create power.
They express state.

---

## 2. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SYSTEMS

- **Mechanica v4** determines what is possible and what it costs.
- **Resonance System v1** determines how emotional physics behaves.
- **Symbol System** determines how those behaviors are expressed sensorially.

Symbols are the *output layer*, not the engine.

---

## 3. CORE RULE: SYMBOL ≠ MAGIC

Symbols:
- do not cause outcomes
- do not override cost
- do not bypass escalation
- do not imply intent or morality

If a symbol appears to “do” something,
the scene is violating canon.

---

## 4. ALLOWED SYMBOL CHANNELS

All symbolic expression must route through one or more of:

1. Geometry
2. Color
3. Light
4. Sound

No additional symbolic channels are permitted.

---

## 5. SYMBOL SELECTION DISCIPLINE

Per beat or scene:
- Use **1–2 symbol channels maximum**
- Choose symbols that reflect:
  - emotional state
  - environmental pressure
  - resonance weather
  - corridor tier

Over-symbolization weakens meaning.

---

## 6. SYMBOLS AS CONSTRAINTS

Symbols function as **constraints**, not flourishes.

A symbol should:
- signal risk
- foreshadow escalation
- reflect instability or containment
- reinforce emotional truth

Symbols should never exist “because they look cool.”

---

## 7. ERA DRIFT (HIGH-LEVEL)

### Veil
- Minimal symbols
- Subtle light and sound
- Geometry mostly implied

### Neon
- Fractures, strobe, saturation
- Visible instability
- Symbol overload risk

### Loom
- Collapse geometry
- Environmental dominance
- Heavy sound and spatial distortion

### Post-Mending
- Prismatic filtration
- Softer expression
- Reduced amplitude

---

## 8. CANON GUARDRAILS

If a symbol:
- contradicts Mechanica
- overrides Resonance behavior
- escalates without cause
- implies prophecy or destiny

…it is invalid.

---

## 9. INTEGRATION NOTES

This system integrates with:
- Resonance Expression Rules
- Emotional Modes & Instability
- Channel Rules (MT / VT / LT)
- Post-Mending filtration constraints

## 10. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Expand Geometry Motif Rules
- [ ] Expand Color Semantics
- [ ] Expand Sound Motif Rules
- [ ] Define VFX ceilings by era
