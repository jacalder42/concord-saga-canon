## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines the **geometric motifs** used to express resonance state, emotional pressure, and structural integrity.

Geometry is the **most mechanically loaded symbolic channel**.
It reflects stability, strain, and failure more directly than color or light.

Geometry never creates power.
It reveals condition.

---

## 2. CORE RULES FOR GEOMETRY

- Geometry reflects structure, not emotion directly.
- Geometry escalates with pressure.
- Geometry degrades before collapse.
- Geometry must align with corridor tier and resonance weather.

If geometry appears “clean” during instability, the scene is incorrect.

## 3. LINES & GRIDS — STRUCTURE / CONTAINMENT

### Meaning
- Order
- Control
- Deliberate containment
- Institutional stability

### Common Contexts
- Dominion architecture
- Technarch systems
- Controlled civic spaces
- Early Veil environments

### Behavior Under Pressure
- Lines tighten
- Grids distort
- Angles sharpen

### Failure Mode
- Lines snap
- Grids warp
- Order collapses into fracture

Lines do not bend gracefully.
They fail suddenly.

---

## 4. THREADS & KNOTS — CONNECTION / TENSION

### Meaning
- Relationship
- Emotional linkage
- VT proximity
- Interdependence

### Common Contexts
- Intimate scenes
- VT boundary contact
- Filament rituals
- Shared grounding moments

### Behavior Under Pressure
- Threads thicken
- Knots tighten
- Tension becomes visible

### Failure Mode
- Tangling
- Fraying
- Sudden severance

Threads breaking always carries relational cost.

---

## 5. FRACTURES — INSTABILITY / SHARD PROXIMITY

### Meaning
- Structural failure
- Resonance instability
- Shard presence

### Common Contexts
- Shard-laced corridors (U6)
- High-pressure Neon environments
- Loom collapse zones

### Behavior Under Pressure
- Cracks spread
- Geometry splinters
- Space feels brittle

### Failure Mode
- Fragmentation
- Collapse
- Rupture initiation

Fractures are never decorative.
They are warnings.

---

## 6. SPIRALS — TURBULENCE / LOSS OF CONTROL

### Meaning
- Instability in motion
- Feedback loops
- Emotional overwhelm

### Common Contexts
- Crowd panic
- Emotional overload
- Rapid escalation scenes

### Behavior Under Pressure
- Spirals accelerate
- Orientation destabilizes
- Direction becomes unclear

### Failure Mode
- Disorientation
- Loss of agency
- Escalation cascade

Spirals indicate danger, not mysticism.

---

## 7. CONCENTRIC RINGS — STABILIZATION / REGULATION

### Meaning
- Grounding
- Regulation
- Containment without force

### Common Contexts
- Stabilization rituals
- Emotional regulation
- Node environments
- Caretaking moments

### Behavior Under Pressure
- Rings thicken
- Rhythm stabilizes
- Expansion slows

### Failure Mode
- Ring break
- Dissolution
- Reversion to fracture

Rings require effort.
They do not persist automatically.

---

## 8. PRISMATIC PLANES — POST-MENDING ONLY

### Meaning
- Filtration
- Clarity
- Breathable Veil presence

### Common Contexts
- Echo Nodes
- Ascendant perception
- Post-Mending quiet scenes

### Behavior Under Pressure
- Gentle refraction
- No sharp edges
- No escalation

### Failure Mode
- None (by design)

If prismatic planes appear pre-Mending, canon is broken.

---

## 9. ERA DRIFT IN GEOMETRY

### Veil
- Mostly implied geometry
- Clean lines
- Minimal distortion

### Neon
- Visible fractures
- Aggressive angles
- Escalating instability

### Loom
- Collapsing geometry
- Spatial dominance
- Environmental failure foregrounded

### Post-Mending
- Softened forms
- Filtered geometry
- Stability without rigidity

---

## 10. USAGE CONSTRAINTS

- Use **one primary geometry motif per beat**
- Do not stack fractures + spirals unless escalation is extreme
- Geometry must reflect cost already paid or about to be paid

If geometry looks impressive without consequence, it is wrong.

---

## 11. INTEGRATION NOTES

Geometry motifs integrate with:
- Corridor tiers (U1–U7)
- Resonance weather (W0–W4)
- Emotional instability profiles
- Mechanica cost escalation

## 12. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Optional: add corridor-specific geometry quick table
- [ ] Optional: add shard vs node geometry contrast diagram
