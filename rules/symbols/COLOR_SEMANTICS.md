## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines how **color functions as a symbolic signal** within the Concord Saga.

Color expresses:
- emotional pressure
- resonance state
- instability or regulation

Color does **not** express:
- morality
- alignment
- destiny
- power level

Color is diagnostic, not declarative.

---

## 2. CORE RULES FOR COLOR

- Color reflects **emotional pressure**, not intent.
- Color intensity scales with instability.
- Color never replaces geometry or cost.
- Color must align with resonance state and environment.

If color implies judgment or prophecy, the scene is incorrect.

## 3. EMOTIONAL COLOR SPECTRUM (CANON)

### RED — Fear / Anger
- Signals: threat, urgency, aggression
- Behavior: sharp, intrusive
- Risk: rapid escalation, collateral damage

Red is volatile, not evil.

---

### ORANGE — Volatility
- Signals: instability, transition
- Behavior: flickering, unstable gradients
- Risk: unpredictable outcomes

Orange is the color of things about to change.

---

### YELLOW — Strain / Overload
- Signals: stress, saturation
- Behavior: harsh brightness, strobe-adjacent
- Risk: shard precursors

Yellow is a warning, not illumination.

---

### GREEN — Grounding / Regulation
- Signals: stabilization, care
- Behavior: soft, steady
- Risk: fragile under pressure

Green requires effort to sustain.

---

### BLUE — Clarity / Truth
- Signals: perceptual accuracy
- Behavior: cool, clean tones
- Risk: detachment if overused

Blue reveals; it does not comfort.

---

### INDIGO — Grief
- Signals: loss, persistence
- Behavior: heavy, lingering hues
- Risk: environmental imprinting

Indigo does not fade quickly.

---

### VIOLET — VT Boundary Interaction
- Signals: metaphysical proximity
- Behavior: planar, precise
- Risk: misalignment if forced

Violet is bounded and restrained.

---

### WHITE — Empathy / Filtration
- Signals: care, integration
- Behavior: diffused, prismatic post-Mending
- Risk: misinterpretation as purity

White is connective, not cleansing.

---

### BLACK — Containment / Collapse
- Signals: suppression, failure
- Behavior: absorption, silence
- Risk: stored pressure, rupture

Black is not absence.
It is compression.

---

## 4. COLOR INTENSITY & PRESSURE

- Low intensity = background emotional tone
- Medium intensity = active pressure
- High intensity = escalation or failure imminent

High saturation without cost violates canon.

---

## 5. COLOR VS GEOMETRY

Color answers:
- *how it feels*

Geometry answers:
- *how stable it is*

Color must never contradict geometry.
If geometry fractures, color must reflect strain.

---

## 6. ERA DRIFT IN COLOR

### Veil
- Muted palette
- Subtle shifts
- Color often implied, not explicit

### Neon
- High saturation
- Aggressive contrast
- Visual overload risk

### Loom
- Harsh palettes
- Environmental dominance
- Color tied to collapse

### Post-Mending
- Softer spectrum
- Prismatic filtration
- Reduced saturation extremes

---

## 7. COMMON MISUSES (FORBIDDEN)

- Color as moral shorthand (“red = bad”)
- Color as power indicator
- Color without emotional cause
- Rainbow effects pre-Mending

If color looks “cool” but says nothing about pressure, it is wrong.

---

## 8. INTEGRATION NOTES

Color semantics integrate with:
- Emotional Modes & Instability
- Resonance Expression Rules
- Geometry Motifs
- Mechanica escalation thresholds

---

## 9. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Optional: add quick color → instability lookup table
- [ ] Optional: add city-specific palette notes
