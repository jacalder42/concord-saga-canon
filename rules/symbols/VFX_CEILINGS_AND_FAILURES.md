## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines **what symbolic expression is allowed**, **what is forbidden**, and **what constitutes a visual failure**.

It exists to:
- prevent spectacle creep
- prevent genre drift
- enforce emotional realism
- protect Mechanica and Resonance integrity

If a visual looks impressive but violates these rules, it is wrong.

---

## 2. CORE CEILING RULE

No symbolic expression may exceed:
- the current **era**
- the current **resonance state**
- the current **environmental pressure**
- the **cost already paid**

Visual intensity must always trail consequence — never lead it.

---

## 3. ERA-BASED VFX CEILINGS

### 3.1 VEIL — LOW CEILING

**Allowed**
- subtle light shifts
- faint flicker
- implied geometry
- barely audible hum

**Forbidden**
- visible fractures
- strobe lighting
- overt color saturation
- prismatic effects

Veil visuals should often be *missed*.

---

### 3.2 NEON — MEDIUM–HIGH CEILING

**Allowed**
- fractures
- flicker and buzz
- aggressive geometry
- partial strobe under escalation

**Forbidden**
- sustained prismatic planes
- omnipresent effects
- spectacle without cost

Neon visuals are unstable, not epic.

---

### 3.3 LOOM — HIGH CEILING (COLLAPSE)

**Allowed**
- collapse geometry
- dominant soundscapes
- hostile environments
- resonance storms

**Forbidden**
- visual beauty without consequence
- heroic framing
- aestheticized apocalypse

Loom visuals should feel exhausting and unsafe.

---

### 3.4 POST-MENDING — FILTERED CEILING

**Allowed**
- prismatic filtration
- softened geometry
- calmer light and sound
- Echo Node stabilization visuals

**Forbidden**
- shards
- ruptures
- catastrophic storms
- escalation beyond NODE

Post-Mending visuals are quieter, not weaker.

---

## 4. COMMON VISUAL FAILURE MODES (FORBIDDEN)

### 4.1 SPECTACLE WITHOUT COST
- Big visuals
- No aftermath
- No exhaustion
- No fallout

This is non-canon.

---

### 4.2 MAGIC-SHAPED IMAGERY
- Runes
- Sigils
- Spell-like effects
- Energy beams

Resonance is not magic.

---

### 4.3 SYSTEM VOICE VISUALS
- Text in the air
- Cosmic diagrams
- UI overlays tied to metaphysics

These violate channel separation.

---

### 4.4 PROPHECY IMAGERY
- Destiny visuals
- Preordained symbols
- “Chosen” framing

The saga rejects prophecy.

---

### 4.5 AESTHETICIZED SUFFERING
- Beautiful collapse
- Glamorous trauma
- Stylized grief without weight

This violates tone and ethics.

---

## 5. FAILURE AS CORRECT OUTPUT

Visual failure is not a bug.
It is the system working.

Failure visuals include:
- loss of signal
- geometry collapse
- sound dropouts
- visual quieting

Absence is often the correct choice.

---

## 6. VFX ESCALATION ORDER (RULE OF THUMB)

Correct escalation order:
1. Sound distortion
2. Light instability
3. Color saturation
4. Geometry deformation
5. Environmental collapse

Skipping steps is allowed only under extreme pressure.

---

## 7. INTEGRATION NOTES

This file enforces limits across:
- Geometry Motifs
- Color Semantics
- Light & Sound Motifs
- Mechanica v4 escalation rules
- Resonance state progression

When in doubt: reduce intensity.

---

## 8. FINAL GUARDRAIL

If a visual:
- looks cinematic but feels empty
- explains instead of expresses
- replaces emotional consequence

It must be removed.

---

## 9. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Optional: add “common mistakes” image callouts
- [ ] Optional: add Loom exhaustion checklist
