Phase: 1A Migration
Applies To: Veil, Neon, Loom, Post-Mending

---

## 1. AUTHORITY STATEMENT

Mechanica v4 is the authoritative mechanical framework governing resonance physics, action cost, escalation limits, environmental interaction, and channel separation across the Concord Saga.

Mechanica v4 supersedes all prior mechanical drafts, including but not limited to:
- Mechanica v1–v3
- Veil Mechanics drafts
- Shard Mechanics v1
- Breathable Veil v1
- Any character- or scene-specific “power logic” not aligned with v4

In the event of conflict, Mechanica v4 takes precedence over all other documents.

---

## 2. PURPOSE OF MECHANICA

Mechanica exists to:
- Prevent power creep
- Prevent metaphysical hand-waving
- Enforce visible cost
- Preserve human-scale causality
- Ensure resonance remains emotional physics, not magic

Mechanica constrains what is possible, how costly it is, and how the world responds under pressure.
It does not dictate story outcomes or moral meaning.

---

## 3. WHAT MECHANICA GOVERNS

Mechanica governs:
- Resonance physics
- Action cost (UARS)
- Environmental modifiers
- Corridor ecology (U1–U7)
- Resonance weather (W0–W4)
- Resonance states (CALM → BLOOM → SHARD → RUPTURE → NODE)
- Shard progression
- Channel separation (MT / VT / LT)
- Post-Mending filtration
- Ascension and Intent constraints
- Symbol → action permissions (VFX ceilings)

---

## 4. WHAT MECHANICA DOES NOT GOVERN

Mechanica does NOT govern:
- Character motivation or psychology
- Ethics, morality, or “rightness”
- Plot direction
- Dialogue content
- Romance dynamics beyond cost/pressure constraints
- Authorial metaphor not tied to action or consequence

Mechanica constrains possibility and consequence, not meaning.
## 5. CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### 5.1 Resonance Is Emotional Physics
Resonance is not magic.
It is the interaction of human emotional states with the structure of the world.

Resonance arises from:
- Will
- Emotion
- Intent

It does not grant wishes.
It does not bypass causality.
It always exacts a cost.

---

### 5.2 Cost Is Mandatory
Every resonance-influenced action incurs cost in one or more domains:
- Physical
- Psychological
- Relational
- Environmental
- Technological

Costs must be visible on the page.
Invisible cost is equivalent to cheating.

---

### 5.3 Escalation Is Earned
Power escalation requires:
- Pressure accumulation
- Emotional stakes
- Environmental conditions

No character may escalate tiers without consequence.
No escalation is permanent without lasting impact.

---

### 5.4 Environment Is Active
Where an action occurs matters as much as:
- Who acts
- What they intend

Cities, materials, humidity, crowds, corridors, and weather materially alter outcomes.

---

### 5.5 Channels Are Separate
MT ≠ VT ≠ LT

Resonance never transmits digitally.
Technology may distort, fail, or degrade under pressure, but cannot carry resonance.

---

## 6. NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS

The following rules are absolute:

- No resurrection
- No supernatural entities
- No metaphysical villains
- No emotion-free power
- No digital resonance transmission
- No ascension without empathy + Intent
- Manufactured metas cannot ascend
- Public metaphysics are forbidden in-world

Violating these breaks canon.
## 7. TRILOGY ESCALATION MODEL

Mechanica behavior escalates across eras.

---

### 7.1 Veil Trilogy
- Resonance effects are subtle
- Low amplitude
- Heavy institutional suppression
- Minimal visible geometry
- Early shard precursors only (flickers, ghostwaves)
- Technology mostly stable

---

### 7.2 Neon Trilogy
- Fracture and instability increase
- Shards emerge
- Tech disruption becomes common
- Emotional amplification is visible
- Extremist misuse escalates consequences
- Cost curves steepen

---

### 7.3 Loom Trilogy
- Systemic collapse
- Resonance storms dominate
- Corridor failures widespread
- Shards shape geography
- Action costs spike dramatically
- Stabilization becomes rare and costly

---

### 7.4 Post-Mending World
- Breathable Veil filters resonance
- No new shards or ruptures
- Only Echo Nodes remain
- Resonance still costs
- Catastrophic escalation is prevented, not erased

The world is stable, not utopian.
## 8. RESONANCE POTENTIAL (RP)

Resonance Potential is defined as:

RP = Will × Emotion × Intent

This equation governs all resonance-influenced outcomes.

---

## 9. VARIABLE DEFINITIONS

### Will
The capacity to act.
Includes stamina, focus, resolve, and persistence.

Will is finite.
It depletes under sustained pressure.

---

### Emotion
The intensity of felt emotional state.
Emotion amplifies resonance but destabilizes control.

Higher emotion increases power and risk simultaneously.

---

### Intent
The directional clarity of purpose.
Intent shapes resonance outcomes.

Intent is not desire.
Intent is commitment to consequence.

Absence of Intent produces instability.

---

## 10. ON-PAGE PROXY MODEL

For narrative use, RP is expressed as:

Energy × Emotion × Intent

Energy represents observable exertion.
This allows resonance to be shown without math.

---

## 11. SCALING & COST PHILOSOPHY

- Higher RP increases effect and cost
- Boosts beyond ~20% incur steep, nonlinear consequences
- Repeated boosts compound penalties
- No action is free
## 12. UARS — UNIFIED ACTION–RESONANCE SYSTEM

UARS governs the cost, limits, and consequences of any action taken under resonance pressure.

UARS exists to ensure:
- All power is costly
- Escalation is constrained
- Consequences accumulate
- Failure is meaningful

UARS applies to:
- Physical actions
- Emotional regulation
- Perceptual enhancement
- Environmental shaping
- Stabilization and containment efforts

---

## 13. ACTION STATES

All actions occur within one of the following ActionStates:

### 13.1 Baseline
- Ordinary human action
- Minimal resonance involvement
- Costs accrue normally
- Most scenes begin here

---

### 13.2 Boosted
- Deliberate amplification of capability
- Increased cost in one or more domains
- Short-duration advantage
- Common in Neon and Loom

---

### 13.3 Rupture-Risk
- Sustained or stacked boosts
- Environmental instability present
- Failure risk escalates sharply
- Shard interaction likely

---

### 13.4 Proto-Ascendant (Gated)
- Extremely rare
- Requires empathy + Intent alignment
- Carries permanent consequence risk
- Not accessible to manufactured metas
- Not a “power-up” state

---

## 14. BOOSTS

A boost is any deliberate increase beyond baseline capability.

Boost types include:
- Physical (strength, speed, endurance)
- Perceptual (clarity, awareness, focus)
- Emotional (regulation, amplification, suppression)
- Environmental (field shaping, stabilization)
- Relational (connection-driven mitigation)

---

## 15. BOOST COSTS

Every boost incurs cost in one or more categories:

- Physical: injury, exhaustion, sickness
- Psychological: dissociation, burnout, emotional bleed
- Relational: trust damage, emotional fallout
- Environmental: instability, collateral effects
- Technological: interference, failure, degradation

Costs must be visible on-page.

---

## 16. BOOST THRESHOLDS

### 16.1 Minor Boosts (< ~20%)
- Recoverable with rest and grounding
- Still leave residue

### 16.2 Major Boosts (> ~20%)
- Nonlinear cost escalation
- High risk of lasting harm
- Increased failure probability

This threshold is not numerical on-page, but conceptual:
Crossing it always matters.

---

## 17. STACKING & DIMINISHING RETURNS

- Multiple boosts stack cost faster than benefit
- Repeated boosts in short windows compound penalties
- Diminishing returns apply under fatigue or pressure
- “Pushing through” worsens outcomes

---

## 18. FAILURE MODES

Failure may manifest as:
- Misalignment (Intent distortion)
- Blowback (self-harm or collateral)
- Resonance sickness
- Dissociation or emotional collapse
- Environmental destabilization

Failure is never clean.
## 19. ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFIERS

Environment actively shapes resonance behavior and cost.

Where something happens can outweigh who acts.

---

## 20. CONDUCTIVITY HIERARCHY

From highest to lowest resonance conductivity:

1. Water
2. Humidity
3. Glass
4. Metal
5. Stone
6. Air
7. Crowds

Higher conductivity:
- Amplifies resonance
- Increases instability
- Raises cost and risk

---

## 21. MATERIAL BEHAVIOR

### Water / Humidity
- Strong amplification
- Emotional bleed-through
- Memory persistence
- High instability in storms

---

### Glass
- Amplifies and refracts resonance
- Produces distortion and glitch effects
- Shatters under strain

---

### Metal
- Conducts and sharpens effects
- Interferes with tech
- Produces feedback loops

---

### Stone
- Stores structural memory
- Resists change
- Fails catastrophically when overloaded

---

### Air
- Lowest conductivity
- Fast dissipation
- Least predictable spread

---

## 22. CROWD PHYSICS

Crowds multiply patterns.

- Emotional states propagate rapidly
- Panic and calm both amplify
- Individual control decreases
- Cascades can overwhelm stabilizers

Crowds are never neutral.

---

## 23. TECHNOLOGY INTERFERENCE

Resonance does not travel through technology.

Instead:
- AR and holochat distort
- Signals degrade or drop
- Hardened systems fail later, not never
- Failure produces meaningful narrative consequences

Technology is a casualty, not a carrier.
## 24. CORRIDOR TIERS OVERVIEW

Corridors define spatial stability under resonance pressure.

They range from U1 (stable) to U7 (quiet veil).

---

## 25. CORRIDOR DEFINITIONS

### U1 — Stable
- Safe passage
- Normal cost curves
- Reliable comms and travel

---

### U2 — Static
- Mild jitter
- Minor amplification
- Early warning zone

---

### U3 — Pressure
- Compression and saturation
- Elevated cost
- Emotional bleed common

---

### U4 — Memory
- Echo effects
- Past emotional imprints surface
- Time perception distortion

---

### U5 — Bloom
- Resonance expansion
- Beauty and danger intertwined
- High reward, high risk

---

### U6 — Shard-Laced
- Fractures present
- Severe instability
- Catastrophic failure likely

---

### U7 — Quiet Veil
- Hush and stillness
- Post-Mending clarity
- Limited access
- No escalation permitted

---

## 26. ENTRY & EXIT TELLS

Corridor shifts are sensed through:
- Light behavior
- Sound changes
- Geometric distortion
- Emotional pressure

Characters do not need labels to recognize danger.

---

## 27. PERMISSIONS BY TIER

- Higher tiers restrict available actions
- Boost costs rise sharply in U5–U6
- Stabilization becomes harder, not easier
- U7 forbids aggressive escalation

---

## 28. SPECIAL CASES

Hinge zones, scars, and nodes:
- Override local stability
- Obey corridor logic at higher scale
- Never break system rules
## 29. RESONANCE WEATHER OVERVIEW

Resonance weather describes large-scale emotional–environmental pressure patterns.
Weather affects:
- Action cost
- Communication reliability
- Crowd behavior
- Travel safety
- Escalation thresholds

Weather states progress as pressure accumulates.

---

## 30. WEATHER STATES

### W0 — Clear
- Stable conditions
- Minimal distortion
- Normal cost curves
- Reliable travel and comms

---

### W1 — Haze
- Soft distortion
- Early emotional bleed
- Minor comms interference
- Elevated vigilance required

---

### W2 — Squall
- Visible ripples
- Color and sound distortion
- Comms unstable
- Crowds become volatile
- Cost increases noticeable

---

### W3 — Gale
- Strong amplification
- Geometry warps
- Travel dangerous
- Action costs spike
- Failure risk high

---

### W4 — Landfall
- Catastrophic pressure
- Resonance storms
- Shards or rupture-level events likely
- Communication collapse
- Survival priority only

---

## 31. WEATHER TRANSITIONS

Weather escalates due to:
- Accumulated emotional pressure
- Shard proximity
- Crowd density
- Environmental conductivity

Weather de-escalates slowly and unevenly.
Sudden calm is suspicious.

---

## 32. SENSORY TELLS

Weather manifests through:
- Light saturation or strobing
- Sound distortion or hum
- Geometric instability
- Emotional pressure changes
## 33. RESONANCE STATES

Resonance states describe the condition of the emotional field.

---

### CALM
- Stable emotional field
- Low cost
- Predictable outcomes

---

### BLOOM
- Emotional expansion
- Heightened connection
- Increased cost and risk
- Beauty and danger coexist

---

### SHARD
- Fracture present
- Instability dominates
- Tech failure common
- Environmental threat

---

### RUPTURE
- System collapse
- Violent resonance discharge
- Catastrophic consequences
- Lasting damage

---

### NODE
- Stabilized convergence
- Structured resonance flow
- Post-Mending replacement for shards

---

### VT
- Metaphysical boundary interaction
- Precision sensory language required
- No slang or metaphor bleed

---

### LT
- Post-Mending prismatic filtration
- Ascendant-only perception
- Gentle, non-coercive presence

---

## 34. SHARD PROGRESSION MODEL

Shard escalation follows this ladder:

1. Flicker
2. Ghostwave
3. Fracture
4. Rupture

---

### Flicker
- Momentary instability
- Easily missed
- Warning sign

---

### Ghostwave
- Repeating disturbance
- Emotional echoes
- Tech glitches increase

---

### Fracture
- Persistent break
- Environmental deformation
- Dangerous escalation window

---

### Rupture
- Total failure
- Violent discharge
- Permanent scar creation

---

## 35. CONTAINMENT & STABILIZATION

Stabilization requires:
- Empathy
- Intent clarity
- Structural support
- Grounding rituals

Force worsens outcomes.
## 36. CHANNEL SEPARATION

There are three channels:
- MT (Mortal Technology)
- VT (Veil-Touch)
- LT (Luminous Thread)

Channels never merge.

---

## 37. MT — MORTAL TECHNOLOGY

MT is purely mortal.
It can:
- Communicate information
- Record events
- Coordinate action

MT cannot:
- Transmit resonance
- Access VT or LT

Under pressure, MT:
- Distorts
- Degrades
- Fails

---

## 38. VT — VEIL-TOUCH

VT is metaphysical.
It is:
- Precise
- Intimate
- Bounded

VT:
- Never broadcasts
- Never travels digitally
- Appears as distortion, not signal

Language must be exact and restrained.

---

## 39. LT — LUMINOUS THREAD

LT exists only post-Mending.
It is:
- Prismatic
- Filtrating
- Gentle

LT:
- Is perceivable only by ascendants
- Does not override human agency
- Cannot be used coercively

Civilians perceive only calm or clarity.
## 40. POST-MENDING MECHANICAL SHIFT

The Mending permanently alters how resonance behaves.

Catastrophic escalation is no longer possible.
Cost, consequence, and human error remain.

This shift is structural, not moral.

---

## 41. THE BREATHABLE VEIL

The Breathable Veil is a prismatic filtration membrane formed during the Mending.

It:
- Filters resonance amplitude
- Prevents shard formation
- Dampens runaway escalation
- Preserves emotional expression

The Veil does not erase resonance.
It regulates it.

---

## 42. FILTRATION MECHANICS

Filtration operates by:
- Reducing peak amplitude
- Smoothing sharp emotional spikes
- Preventing fracture thresholds from being crossed

Filtration does NOT:
- Remove cost
- Remove responsibility
- Guarantee safety
- Resolve trauma

Human failure remains possible.

---

## 43. ECHO NODES

Echo Nodes replace shards post-Mending.

Nodes are:
- Stable convergence points
- Non-catastrophic
- Emotionally resonant
- Environmentally integrated

Nodes:
- Do not rupture
- Do not expand violently
- Do not escalate weather beyond safe bounds

They act as anchors, not weapons.

---

## 44. GLOBAL EFFECTS

Post-Mending:
- Shards no longer exist
- Ruptures cannot form
- Resonance storms are filtered into weather
- Cities develop stable resonance dialects

The world is quieter, not simpler.
## 45. INTENT AS A MECHANICAL REQUIREMENT

Intent is the directional constraint on resonance.

Intent requires:
- Commitment to consequence
- Emotional honesty
- Acceptance of outcome

Power without Intent is unstable.

---

## 46. ASCENSION CONSTRAINTS

Ascension is not a reward.
It is a structural role shift.

Requirements:
- Empathy
- Intent alignment
- Sustained cost
- Irreversible change

Ascension:
- Cannot be forced
- Cannot be replicated
- Cannot be inherited

---

## 47. PROTO-ASCENDANT STATE

Proto-Ascendant actions:
- Are temporary
- Carry permanent risk
- Occur only under extreme conditions

This state is gated and rare.

---

## 48. MANUFACTURED METAS

Manufactured metas possess:
- Power
- Capability
- Amplification

They lack:
- Intent
- Emotional integration

As a result:
- They are permanently unstable
- They cannot ascend
- They fail catastrophically under pressure

Their creators are the true antagonists.
## 49. SYMBOLIC PERMISSION SYSTEM

Symbols do not create power.
They express it.

Mechanica constrains what symbols are allowed to do.

---

## 50. VFX PILLARS

All resonance expression must route through:
- Color
- Light
- Sound
- Geometry

No additional channels are permitted.

---

## 51. EMOTIONAL COLOR SPECTRUM

- Red: fear / anger
- Orange: volatility
- Yellow: strain / overload
- Green: grounding / stabilization
- Blue: clarity / truth
- Indigo: grief
- Violet: VT boundary
- White: empathy / filtration
- Black: containment / collapse

---

## 52. GEOMETRY AS MECHANICS

- Lines / grids: structure, containment
- Threads / knots: connection, tension
- Fractures: instability
- Spirals: turbulence
- Concentric rings: stabilization
- Prismatic planes: post-Mending clarity only

---

## 53. SOUND MOTIFS

- Hum: stability
- Buzz / static: friction
- Pulse: emotional spike
- Harmonics: connection
- Undertone: shard proximity

Symbols must reflect mechanics, not override them.
## 54. PURPOSE OF ON-PAGE RULES

These rules govern how Mechanica appears in prose.
They exist to ensure consistency, restraint, and visible consequence.

Mechanica should be felt, not explained.

---

## 55. SHOW THE COST

Every resonance-influenced action must show:
- At least one immediate cost
- At least one lingering consequence (physical, emotional, relational, or environmental)

If no cost is visible, the action should not occur.

---

## 56. MOTIF SELECTION LIMITS

Per beat or scene:
- Use a maximum of 1–2 motif channels (color, light, sound, geometry)
- Do not stack all effects
- Restraint increases impact

Overuse of effects equals loss of meaning.

---

## 57. SCENE-TYPE APPLICATION

### Civic / Slice-of-Life
- Subtle resonance cues
- Low amplitude
- Focus on grounding and regulation

---

### Investigation
- Perceptual strain
- Tech interference
- Emotional bleed as signal noise

---

### Action / Conflict
- Rising cost curves
- Environmental damage
- Failure risk escalates visibly

---

### Intimacy / Grounding
- Resonance expresses connection
- Cost is vulnerability, not spectacle
- Consent and regulation are mandatory

---

## 58. ESCALATION DISCIPLINE

Escalation must be justified by:
- Emotional stakes
- Environmental pressure
- Narrative necessity

Escalation without pressure breaks canon.

---

## 59. FAILURE IS STORY

Failure is not a setback.
Failure is a mechanical output.

Misalignment, collapse, or withdrawal should:
- Change character behavior
- Alter relationships
- Modify environment

Failure must leave residue.

---

## 60. NO MECHANICAL EXPLANATION IN-DIALOGUE

Characters do not explain Mechanica.
They experience it.

Exposition belongs in action and consequence, not speech.

---

## 61. CONTINUITY CHECKS

Before finalizing a scene, verify:
- Channel separation respected
- Cost shown
- Environment accounted for
- Escalation justified
- No forbidden behaviors triggered
