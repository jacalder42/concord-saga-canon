## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines how **crowds interact with resonance**.

It exists to:
- formalize crowd amplification mechanics
- explain mass panic and calm propagation
- support civic-scale escalation logic
- ground extremist movements in resonance physics

Crowds do not create resonance.
They multiply it.
## 2. PATTERN MULTIPLICATION

Crowds function as **pattern multipliers**.

Individual emotional states:
- propagate rapidly
- reinforce dominant signals
- reduce individual regulation capacity

In crowds:
- calm spreads slower than panic
- fear escalates faster than grief
- suppression amplifies volatility
## 3. PANIC CASCADES

Panic spreads via:
- visual cues
- sound escalation
- perceived threat amplification

Effects:
- rapid escalation
- loss of fine control
- shard precursors in high-conductivity zones
## 4. CALM PROPAGATION

Calm spreads via:
- trusted anchors
- clear information
- visible grounding behavior

Effects:
- slowed escalation
- reduced cost curves
- temporary stabilization

Calm requires effort.
It is fragile under pressure.
## 5. GRIEF SATURATION

Grief in crowds:
- persists longer
- imprints environments
- creates memory-heavy zones

Effects:
- delayed instability
- echo formation
- slow escalation toward shard conditions
## 6. DENSITY EFFECTS

Higher density:
- increases amplification
- shortens escalation timelines
- overwhelms individual regulation

Lower density:
- allows partial containment
- slows propagation
## 7. ENVIRONMENTAL CONDUCTIVITY

Crowd effects intensify in:
- humidity
- enclosed spaces
- reflective materials
- transit hubs

Crowds plus high conductivity are the most dangerous configuration.
## 8. CIVILIAN MISATTRIBUTION

Civilians often interpret crowd resonance as:
- riots
- hysteria
- infrastructure failure
- mass psychosis

This misattribution:
- delays response
- fuels authoritarian overreach
- increases eventual collapse
## 9. RESONANCE EXPLOITATION

Extremist movements:
- weaponize fear
- suppress emotional complexity
- promote certainty narratives

These actions:
- accelerate escalation
- increase shard risk
- produce unstable followers
## 10. THE CHOIRLESS CASE

The Choirless doctrine:
- frames emotion as entropy
- seeks enforced calm
- suppresses grief and fear

Result:
- stored pressure
- catastrophic release
- mass-scale instability

Calm without empathy is violence.
## 11. CROWD STABILIZATION

Effective stabilization requires:
- multiple anchors
- shared rituals
- visible grounding
- time

Force worsens outcomes.
Silence increases pressure.
## 12. ERA DRIFT

---

### Veil
- denial dominant
- slow escalation
- localized crowd events

---

### Neon
- rapid panic cascades
- media amplification
- shard events common

---

### Loom
- exhaustion saturation
- grief-heavy crowds
- systemic collapse risk

---

### Post-Mending
- dampened amplification
- improved emotional literacy
- crowds still volatile, but survivable
## 13. INTEGRATION

This document integrates with:
- Resonance Escalation Logic
- Emotional Modes and Instability
- Mechanica v4 (environment, cost, corridors)

## 14. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Optional: add transit hub case study
- [ ] Optional: add protest vs vigil contrast
