# RESONANCE ESCALATION LOGIC
Status: Authoritative Canon (Expansion)
Source: Resonance System v1 + Mechanica v4
Phase: Phase 1B Expansion
Applies To: Veil, Neon, Loom, Post-Mending

## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines **how and why resonance escalates** from stable states into dangerous ones.

It exists to:
- clarify escalation triggers
- prevent “sudden magic” events
- ensure cause precedes consequence
- support consistent shard and rupture logic

This document does not define cost.
Cost is governed by Mechanica v4.
## 2. NO SPONTANEOUS ESCALATION

Resonance escalation is never random.

Escalation always results from:
- emotional pressure
- failed regulation
- environmental amplification
- repeated misuse
- ignored warning signs

If escalation appears sudden, the cause must exist earlier in the narrative.
## 3. CORE DRIVERS OF ESCALATION

Escalation is driven by one or more of the following:

1. Emotional intensity
2. Emotional contradiction (mixed states)
3. Suppression and denial
4. Crowd amplification
5. High-conductivity environments
6. Repeated boosts without recovery
7. Structural fragility (corridors, tech, civic systems)
## 4. CALM → BLOOM

Triggered by:
- emotional release after suppression
- mutual connection
- sudden openness

Characteristics:
- expansion
- increased sensitivity
- rising reward and risk

Bloom is not failure.
It is a warning that containment must adjust.
## 5. BLOOM → SHARD

Triggered by:
- sustained overload
- conflicting emotional vectors
- environmental amplification
- failed grounding attempts

Characteristics:
- fracture formation
- instability dominance
- tech and structural failure

Shard formation indicates system failure.
## 6. SHARD → RUPTURE

Triggered by:
- continued pressure after fracture
- panic-driven escalation
- crowd cascades
- high-conductivity conditions

Characteristics:
- violent discharge
- permanent environmental scarring
- irreversible loss

Rupture is always catastrophic.
## 7. EARLY WARNING SIGNS

Common precursors include:
- flicker in light
- low hum or undertone
- emotional saturation
- unexplained tech glitches
- spatial distortion

Ignoring these signs accelerates escalation.
## 8. SUPPRESSION DYNAMICS

Suppression:
- delays escalation
- increases stored pressure
- enlarges eventual failure

Suppression never resolves instability.
## 9. HEALTHY RELEASE

Healthy release requires:
- acknowledgment of emotion
- shared grounding
- acceptance of cost

Release lowers escalation risk but does not remove consequence.
## 10. POST-MENDING LIMITS

After the Mending:
- escalation halts at NODE
- shards cannot form
- rupture is impossible

Escalation still occurs emotionally,
but the world no longer breaks.
## 11. INTEGRATION

This document integrates with:
- Emotional Modes and Instability
- Resonance Expression Rules
- Mechanica v4 (UARS thresholds and cost)
