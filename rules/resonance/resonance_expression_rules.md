# RESONANCE EXPRESSION RULES
Status: Authoritative Canon (Expansion)
Source: Resonance System v1 + Mechanica v4
Phase: Phase 1B Expansion
Applies To: Veil, Neon, Loom, Post-Mending

---

## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines how resonance **expresses itself sensorially**.

It exists to:
- standardize visual and auditory cues
- prevent aesthetic drift
- ensure expression reflects mechanics
- support consistent prose, art, and VFX direction

This document does not define power, cost, or escalation.
Those are governed by Mechanica v4.
## 2. ALLOWED EXPRESSION CHANNELS

Resonance may express only through:

1. Light
2. Sound
3. Geometry
4. Color

No additional channels are permitted.

Expression reflects:
- emotional state
- environmental pressure
- resonance weather
- corridor tier

Expression never overrides mechanics.
## 3. LIGHT BEHAVIOR

Light is the primary indicator of resonance presence.

---

### 3.1 HALOS
- Meaning: empathy, regulation, grounding
- Behavior: soft, diffuse, low saturation
- Common in: calm moments, mutual connection
- Risk: minimal

---

### 3.2 FLICKER
- Meaning: uncertainty, instability
- Behavior: intermittent, uneven
- Common in: early pressure zones, denial states
- Risk: warning sign

---

### 3.3 STROBE
- Meaning: overload, fracture risk
- Behavior: sharp, rhythmic pulses
- Common in: Neon escalation, crowd panic
- Risk: severe

---

### 3.4 BLOOM
- Meaning: emotional expansion
- Behavior: outward light growth
- Common in: connection, release
- Risk: high if uncontrolled

---

### 3.5 PRISMATIC DRIFT (POST-MENDING ONLY)
- Meaning: filtration, clarity
- Behavior: gentle color separation
- Common in: LT influence, Echo Nodes
- Risk: low
## 4. SOUND BEHAVIOR

Sound reflects resonance pressure more reliably than dialogue.

---

### 4.1 HUM
- Meaning: stability, containment
- Tone: low, continuous
- Indicates: safe or stabilizing conditions

---

### 4.2 PULSE
- Meaning: emotional spike
- Tone: rhythmic, heartbeat-like
- Indicates: rising pressure

---

### 4.3 BUZZ / STATIC
- Meaning: friction, tech interference
- Tone: abrasive, irregular
- Indicates: MT degradation or mixed emotional states

---

### 4.4 HARMONICS
- Meaning: alignment, connection
- Tone: layered, musical
- Indicates: successful grounding or mutual Intent

---

### 4.5 UNDERTONE
- Meaning: shard proximity
- Tone: barely audible, unsettling
- Indicates: imminent danger
## 5. GEOMETRY BEHAVIOR

Geometry expresses structural integrity or failure.

---

### 5.1 LINES / GRIDS
- Meaning: structure, containment
- Seen in: Dominion architecture, controlled zones
- Failure mode: snapping or distortion

---

### 5.2 THREADS / KNOTS
- Meaning: connection, tension
- Seen in: relationships, VT proximity
- Failure mode: tangling or fraying

---

### 5.3 FRACTURES
- Meaning: instability
- Seen in: shard zones, high-pressure corridors
- Failure mode: collapse

---

### 5.4 SPIRALS
- Meaning: turbulence
- Seen in: emotional overload, crowd panic
- Failure mode: loss of control

---

### 5.5 CONCENTRIC RINGS
- Meaning: stabilization
- Seen in: grounding rituals, nodes
- Failure mode: ring break

---

### 5.6 PRISMATIC PLANES (POST-MENDING ONLY)
- Meaning: clarity through filtration
- Seen in: Breathable Veil effects
- Failure mode: none (by design)
## 6. EMOTIONAL COLOR SPECTRUM

Color expresses emotional pressure, not morality.

---

- Red: fear, anger
- Orange: volatility
- Yellow: strain, overload
- Green: grounding, regulation
- Blue: clarity, truth
- Indigo: grief
- Violet: VT boundary interaction
- White: empathy, filtration
- Black: containment, collapse

Color must always map to:
- emotional state
- environment
- pressure level

Color alone never implies power.
## 7. ERA-DEPENDENT EXPRESSION

---

### Veil
- Subtle light changes
- Minimal geometry
- Sound mostly absent

---

### Neon
- Strobes, flicker, fractures
- Sound distortion common
- Visual overload risk

---

### Loom
- Collapse geometry
- Resonance storms
- Environmental dominance

---

### Post-Mending
- Soft prismatic effects
- Reduced amplitude
- Clarity without spectacle
## 8. USAGE RULES

- Use 1–2 expression channels per beat
- Avoid stacking effects
- Expression must reflect cost and pressure
- Expression never substitutes for consequence

If expression feels impressive without cost, it is incorrect.
## 9. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Optional: add visual reference appendix
- [ ] Optional: map expression intensity to corridor tiers
