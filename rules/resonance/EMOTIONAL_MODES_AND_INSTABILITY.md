## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines how **specific emotional states shape resonance behavior and instability**.

It exists to:
- clarify how emotion alters risk profiles
- distinguish power from instability
- support consistent escalation logic
- prevent emotional states from becoming “abilities”

Emotion affects *how resonance behaves*, not what it guarantees.
## 2. EMOTION DOES NOT MAP TO OUTCOME

Emotional state determines:
- volatility
- persistence
- amplification style
- failure signature

Emotion does not determine:
- success
- moral valence
- narrative reward

Two identical actions under different emotional states
will produce different risks and costs.
## 3. FEAR

Instability Profile:
- sharp amplification
- tunnel focus
- brittle control

Common Effects:
- rapid escalation
- high fracture risk
- collateral damage

Failure Signatures:
- panic cascades
- crowd amplification
- loss of fine control
## 4. ANGER

Instability Profile:
- directional force
- short-lived clarity
- accelerated burnout

Common Effects:
- powerful initial output
- rapid depletion
- environmental damage

Failure Signatures:
- physical injury
- relational harm
- rebound collapse
## 5. GRIEF

Instability Profile:
- heavy persistence
- slow distortion
- memory imprinting

Common Effects:
- lingering resonance
- echo formation
- delayed escalation

Failure Signatures:
- dissociation
- environmental haunting
- prolonged instability zones
## 6. LOVE / CONNECTION

Instability Profile:
- stabilizing when mutual
- destabilizing when unilateral
- high modulation potential

Common Effects:
- grounding
- cost reduction when shared
- enhanced containment

Failure Signatures:
- collapse if withdrawn
- overextension
- boundary erosion
## 7. CALM

Instability Profile:
- dampened amplitude
- high perceptual clarity
- reduced escalation

Common Effects:
- lower cost curves
- improved judgment
- enhanced sensing

Failure Signatures:
- suppression masking pressure
- delayed release if false calm
## 8. OVERLOAD

Instability Profile:
- loss of modulation
- strobe behavior
- imminent fracture

Common Effects:
- erratic output
- tech failure
- crowd destabilization

Failure Signatures:
- shard precursors
- collapse events
- burnout or shutdown
## 9. MIXED STATES

Most resonance events involve mixed emotional states.

Mixed states:
- increase unpredictability
- raise UARS cost
- complicate stabilization

Examples:
- fear + anger → explosive escalation
- grief + love → prolonged instability
- calm + denial → delayed rupture

Clean emotional states are rare and unstable.
## 10. SUPPRESSION EFFECTS

Suppressed emotion:
- stores pressure
- masks instability
- increases eventual blast radius

Suppression appears as calm but behaves as overload.

## 11. MISALIGNMENT

Misalignment occurs when:
- emotion and Intent diverge
- action contradicts internal state

Misalignment increases:
- failure probability
- blowback severity
- relational cost
## 12. ERA DRIFT IN EMOTIONAL INSTABILITY

---

### Veil
- suppression common
- delayed failures
- subtle warning signs

---

### Neon
- rapid emotional swings
- visible overload
- frequent mixed states

---

### Loom
- exhaustion dominant
- grief saturation
- systemic collapse risk

---

### Post-Mending
- emotional literacy improves
- instability dampened
- failure remains personal, not catastrophic
## 13. INTEGRATION

This document integrates with:
- Mechanica v4 (cost, thresholds, failure)
- Resonance Expression Rules (sensory tells)
- Resonance Escalation Logic (triggers)

## 14. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Optional: add quick-reference instability table
- [ ] Optional: add civic vs combat emotional profiles
