# LT — LUMINOUS THREAD RULES (POST-MENDING)
Status: Authoritative Canon
Source: Project Memory + Mechanica v4 + Resonance v1
Phase: Phase 1A Migration
Applies To: Post-Mending World Only

---

## 1. WHAT LT IS

LT (Luminous Thread) is the **post-Mending metaphysical channel** formed when the Veil becomes breathable.

LT represents:
- filtered resonance flow
- stabilized boundary ecology
- gentle connective awareness

LT is not an upgrade to VT.
LT is a different channel entirely.

---

## 2. ACCESS & PERCEPTION

LT is perceivable only by:
- ascendants
- post-Mending anchors

Civilians do not perceive LT directly.

Civilians experience LT indirectly as:
- calmer emotional environments
- reduced catastrophic escalation
- clearer emotional ecology

LT never presents as a voice, command, or instruction.

---

## 3. WHAT LT CAN DO

LT can:
- provide gentle alignment cues
- support emotional regulation
- enable quiet recognition between ascendants
- reflect global stabilization

LT operates through:
- filtration
- presence
- resonance smoothing

LT does not provide answers.
LT does not solve problems.

---

## 4. WHAT LT CANNOT DO

LT cannot:
- coerce behavior
- override agency
- transmit information
- function as surveillance
- act independently of humans

LT is not a system.
LT is not a guide.
LT is not an authority.

---

## 5. LT & LANGUAGE CONSTRAINTS

LT scenes must use:
- soft, prismatic imagery
- gentle sensory language
- minimal metaphor layering

LT scenes must avoid:
- declarations
- prophecy
- omniscient tone
- system voice phrasing

LT is felt as clarity, not instruction.

---

## 6. LT & TECHNOLOGY

LT never interacts directly with MT.

MT may appear:
- quieter
- more stable
- less intrusive

This is a byproduct of environmental filtration,
not LT influence on technology.

---

## 7. FAILURE & MISUSE

LT failure does not look like collapse.

Misuse appears as:
- misinterpretation
- projection
- emotional overreach

LT does not punish misuse.
Consequences remain human.

---

## 8. RELATIONSHIP TO VT

VT and LT coexist but do not merge.

- VT = boundary contact
- LT = filtered connective ecology

VT remains sharper.
LT remains softer.

Neither replaces the other.

---

## 9. POST-MENDING SAFEGUARDS

LT enforces:
- no new shards
- no rupture events
- no catastrophic escalation

LT does not prevent:
- conflict
- grief
- human error

The world remains imperfect.

---

## 10. CANON GUARDRAILS

If LT is depicted as:
- directive
- omnipotent
- corrective
- narratively convenient

The scene violates canon.

## 11. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Optional: add LT handshake vignette
- [ ] Optional: add ascendant-only perception contrast
