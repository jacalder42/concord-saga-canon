Phase: Phase 1A Migration

## 1. WHAT MT IS

MT (Mortal Technology) is the **human-built information and communication layer**.

It includes:
- phones
- AR overlays
- holochat
- broadcast media
- recording and storage systems
- data networks and relays

MT is purely mortal.
It contains no metaphysical capacity.

---

## 2. WHAT MT CAN DO

MT can:
- transmit information
- coordinate people
- record events
- amplify narratives
- enable logistics and response

MT can shape **human behavior**, but not resonance itself.

---

## 3. WHAT MT CANNOT DO

MT cannot:
- transmit resonance
- access VT or LT
- perceive metaphysical boundaries
- stabilize resonance directly
- replace human emotional regulation

Any depiction of MT carrying resonance is non-canon.

---

## 4. MT UNDER RESONANCE PRESSURE

Resonance affects MT **indirectly**.

Effects include:
- signal distortion
- data corruption
- dropped connections
- AR desynchronization
- audio/visual glitching

These effects are consequences of environmental instability,
not evidence of metaphysical transmission.

---

## 5. FAILURE PROGRESSION

MT failure follows a predictable downshift pattern:

1. Minor latency and jitter
2. Desynchronization (audio/video mismatch)
3. Partial data loss
4. Intermittent blackout
5. Total failure

Failure accelerates with:
- higher resonance weather
- proximity to shards or scars
- high-conductivity environments
- crowd density

---

## 6. HARDENED VS CIVILIAN SYSTEMS

### Civilian MT
- optimized for convenience
- fails early under pressure
- recovers slowly

### Hardened MT (e.g., Concord systems)
- shielded and redundant
- fails later, not never
- degrades gracefully
- still collapses under extreme conditions

Hardened systems do not break canon rules.
They only delay failure.

---

## 7. MT & MEDIA EFFECTS

MT strongly influences:
- crowd behavior
- panic propagation
- misinformation spread

Media amplification can:
- accelerate resonance escalation
- intensify crowd instability
- worsen shard precursors

MT shapes narrative pressure, not resonance physics.

---

## 8. TRILOGY BEHAVIOR

### Veil
- MT stable and trusted
- minor unexplained glitches dismissed

### Neon
- frequent distortion
- MT becomes unreliable lifeline
- breakdowns visible and frightening

### Loom
- infrastructure collapse
- resopunk repair culture
- patchwork systems dominate

### Post-Mending
- MT stabilizes
- culturally deemphasized
- remains mortal and fragile

---

## 9. INTERACTION WITH OTHER CHANNELS

- MT may distort in VT proximity
- MT may quiet in LT-filtered zones
- MT never carries VT or LT

Distortion is a side effect, not a bridge.

---

## 10. CANON GUARDRAILS

If a scene requires MT to:
- “sense” resonance
- transmit emotion metaphysically
- function perfectly under collapse

The scene must be rewritten.

- [ ] Optional: add MT failure vignette examples
- [ ] Optional: add MT vs rumor dynamics appendix
