# CHANNELS — OVERVIEW (MT / VT / LT)

Phase: Phase 1A Migration
Applies To: Veil, Neon, Loom, Post-Mending

## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines the three-channel model that governs information, perception, and metaphysical boundary contact in the Concord Saga:

- MT — Mortal Technology
- VT — Veil-Touch (metaphysical boundary contact)
- LT — Luminous Thread (post-Mending only)

This model exists to prevent drift into:
- tech-as-magic
- magic-as-broadcast
- metaphysics-as-convenient plot tool

## 2. CORE LAW: CHANNEL SEPARATION

MT ≠ VT ≠ LT

Channels never merge.
Channels never convert into each other.
Channels cannot be used to “send” resonance.

Resonance does not transmit digitally.

Technology may distort under resonance pressure, but it cannot carry metaphysical signal.

---

## 3. MT — MORTAL TECHNOLOGY (WHAT IT IS)

MT is the mortal communications layer:
- phones
- AR overlays
- holochat
- recordings
- broadcast media infrastructure

MT can coordinate, record, and amplify information.
MT cannot access VT or LT.

Under pressure, MT degrades as a consequence of resonance, not as a carrier of it.

---

## 4. VT — VEIL-TOUCH (WHAT IT IS)

VT is metaphysical boundary contact:
- intimate
- bounded
- precise

VT is not a broadcast.
VT is not a system voice.
VT does not “travel” through MT.

VT affects the physical world only indirectly:
- through sensory distortion
- through pressure perception
- through boundary proximity effects

VT language must remain precise and restrained.

---

## 5. LT — LUMINOUS THREAD (WHAT IT IS)

LT exists only after the Mending.

LT is:
- prismatic
- gentle
- filtrating

LT is perceivable only by ascendants.

LT does not override agency.
LT does not coerce.
LT does not replace human responsibility.

Civilians do not perceive LT as a “channel.”
They experience only calmer stability and clearer emotional ecology.

## 6. TRILOGY BEHAVIOR SUMMARY

### Veil
- MT mostly stable
- VT rare and subtle
- No LT

### Neon
- MT increasingly fragile and glitch-prone
- VT contact increases under shard pressure
- No LT

### Loom
- MT collapsing infrastructure; resopunk patch culture dominant
- VT pressure intense near nodes/scars
- No LT until after Mending

### Post-Mending
- MT stabilizes (culturally deemphasized)
- VT remains distinct
- LT exists as ascendant-only prismatic channel

---

## 7. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SYSTEMS

- Mechanica v4 governs cost, escalation, and environmental interaction.
- Resonance v1 governs behavior, feel, and escalation triggers.
- Channels govern permissible information flow and perception boundaries.

Channels are the boundary layer that prevents metaphysical cheating.

## 8. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Confirm whether any legacy “channel terms” need alias notes (for backward compatibility)
- [ ] Optional: add quick reference diagram (text-only) for channel separation
- [ ]
