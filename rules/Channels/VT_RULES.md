# VT — VEIL-TOUCH RULES
Status: Authoritative Canon
Source: Project Memory + Mechanica v4 + Resonance v1
Phase: Phase 1A Migration
Applies To: Veil, Neon, Loom (pre-Mending); persists post-Mending but remains distinct from LT

---

## 1. WHAT VT IS

VT (Veil-Touch) is **direct metaphysical boundary contact**.

VT represents:
- proximity to the Veil
- interaction with resonance at the boundary layer
- heightened perception of pressure, structure, and constraint

VT is:
- intimate
- bounded
- precise

VT is not a power source.
VT is a contact state.

---

## 2. WHAT VT CAN DO

VT can:
- heighten perception of resonance pressure
- reveal structural stress or instability
- enable precise interaction at boundaries
- allow intentional containment or alignment

VT operates through:
- perception
- restraint
- clarity

VT never operates through force.

---

## 3. WHAT VT CANNOT DO

VT cannot:
- broadcast
- transmit through MT
- carry information long-distance
- override human agency
- act without cost

VT is not a channel for messaging, commands, or prophecy.

---

## 4. VT & LANGUAGE CONSTRAINTS

VT scenes must use:
- precise sensory language
- restrained metaphor
- minimal abstraction

VT scenes must avoid:
- slang
- mystical generalities
- declarative prophecy
- system-voice narration

VT is experienced, not explained.

---

## 5. VT & TECHNOLOGY

VT never travels through MT.

MT may exhibit:
- distortion
- desynchronization
- quieting

These are side effects of boundary proximity,
not evidence of VT transmission.

---

## 6. VT UNDER PRESSURE

VT becomes more common under:
- shard proximity
- high resonance weather
- corridor instability

As pressure rises:
- perception sharpens
- cost escalates
- margin for error shrinks

VT always exacts a personal toll.

---

## 7. FAILURE MODES

VT failure manifests as:
- misalignment
- sensory overload
- dissociation
- emotional bleed

Forceful use of VT worsens outcomes.

---

## 8. TRILOGY BEHAVIOR

### Veil
- VT rare and subtle
- often misinterpreted
- heavily suppressed institutionally

### Neon
- VT contact increases
- shard pressure amplifies risk
- precision failures common

### Loom
- VT exposure frequent near nodes and scars
- containment extremely costly
- failure consequences severe

---

## 9. VT POST-MENDING

After the Mending:
- VT persists as boundary contact
- remains distinct from LT
- operates within filtered resonance

VT does not evolve into LT.

---

## 10. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER CHANNELS

- VT may distort MT
- VT coexists with LT without merging
- VT cannot access LT perception

Channels remain separate.

---

## 11. CANON GUARDRAILS

If VT is depicted as:
- omniscient
- prophetic
- transmissible
- effortless

The scene violates canon.

## 12. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Optional: add VT sensory lexicon appendix
- [ ] Optional: add VT failure vignette
