Applies To: Veil, Neon, Loom, Post-Mending

## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines when **supplementary material** is permitted and how it must respect channel boundaries.

Supplements exist to:
- deepen emotional context
- clarify off-page consequences
- provide reflective or aftermath perspective

Supplements do not:
- advance plot
- introduce new mechanics
- override on-page outcomes

---

## 2. WHAT COUNTS AS A SUPPLEMENT

A supplement may include:
- letters
- recorded messages
- journals
- memory fragments
- reflective vignettes
- aftermath scenes

Supplements are:
- optional
- secondary
- emotionally grounded

They are not primary narrative engines.

---

## 3. GENERAL PERMISSION RULE

Supplements are allowed:
- after major events
- after character deaths
- after arc resolutions

As long as they:
- do not contradict canon
- respect channel separation
- do not alter outcomes

---

## 4. ABSOLUTE EXCEPTIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Supplements are **not permitted** after:

1. **Tahl’s death** (Neon Book 6)
2. **Ascension deaths** (Book 9, Act III)

These moments must remain:
- singular
- final
- unsoftened

Any supplement in these windows violates canon.

---

## 5. CHANNEL CONSTRAINTS WITHIN SUPPLEMENTS

### MT Supplements
- May include recordings, messages, archives
- Must obey MT failure and degradation rules
- Cannot carry VT or LT content

---

### VT Supplements
- Must remain intimate and bounded
- No broadcast framing
- No system voice or prophecy

---

### LT Supplements (Post-Mending Only)
- Ascendant perception only
- Gentle, non-directive
- No instruction or revelation

---

## 6. WHAT SUPPLEMENTS CANNOT DO

Supplements cannot:
- resurrect characters
- revise causality
- introduce new metaphysical rules
- bypass cost or consequence
- explain the system

If a supplement explains mechanics, it is invalid.

---

## 7. TONE & PLACEMENT GUIDANCE

Supplements should:
- be quieter than primary scenes
- focus on emotional residue
- deepen meaning, not clarify plot

Placement should:
- follow emotional peaks
- never interrupt escalation
- never reduce stakes retroactively

---

## 8. AUTHORIAL DISCRETION CLAUSE

There are no absolute prohibitions beyond Section 4.

Any supplement is valid **if narratively justified** and if it:
- respects channel boundaries
- preserves finality
- does not undermine consequence

This clause allows flexibility without breaking canon.

---

## 9. INTEGRATION NOTES

This document integrates with:
- Channels Overview (MT / VT / LT separation)
- Mechanica v4 (cost and consequence)
- Resonance v1 (behavior and escalation)

---

## 10. TODO FLAGS

- [ ] Optional: add sample supplement forms
- [ ] Optional: add placement decision tree
