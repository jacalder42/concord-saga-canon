# MANUFACTURED METAS — VARIANTS  
Engineered Failure Modes • Prototype Taxonomy  
Systemic Collapse Expressions (Not Characters)

---

## PURPOSE

This file catalogs **known Manufactured Meta variants** as *design outcomes*, not individuals.

These entries are:
- not characters
- not factions
- not POV-capable entities

They are **prototype expressions of a shared design error**.

Use this file to:
- select the correct failure texture for a scene
- vary threat presentation without inventing new antagonists
- reinforce that each Meta is a different way the same mistake collapses

## VARIANT CLASS I — THE SILVER PATTERN MAN

### Design Intent
- Create a perfectly stable resonance pattern
- Eliminate emotional fluctuation
- Replace Intent with symmetry and recursion

### Observed Behavior
- Hyper-symmetrical movement and form
- Mimics human interaction without comprehension
- Resonance output remains mathematically “clean”
- Fails catastrophically when exposed to emotional variability

### Failure Mode
**Pattern rigidity collapse**

When exposed to:
- grief
- contradiction
- emotional conflict

The pattern:
- fractures
- loops
- accelerates beyond containment

### Narrative Function
Use when you need:
- eerie calm
- uncanny precision
- visual proof that perfection is brittle

---

## VARIANT CLASS II — THE BLINKING GIRL

### Design Intent
- Adaptive resonance response
- Emotional mimicry without vulnerability
- Fast-learning emotional proxy

### Observed Behavior
- Stuttered movement
- Delayed emotional mirroring
- Temporal desynchronization
- Increasing instability under relational proximity

### Failure Mode
**Feedback lag overload**

She copies emotion faster than she can stabilize it.

Results include:
- sudden resonance spikes
- emotional echo storms
- temporal jitter effects

### Narrative Function
Use when you need:
- tragedy
- sympathy without redemption
- proof that imitation is not understanding

---

## VARIANT CLASS III — MIRROR-LAG PROTOTYPE

### Design Intent
- Reactive counter-resonance system
- Neutralize external emotional input
- Defensive containment architecture

### Observed Behavior
- Delayed mirroring of nearby movement or emotion
- Echo-halo visual distortion
- Increasing desync over time

### Failure Mode
**Accumulated echo collapse**

The delay grows until:
- feedback overwhelms containment
- mirrored actions diverge violently
- system destabilizes environment

### Narrative Function
Use when you need:
- environmental distortion
- indirect harm
- resonance pressure without direct aggression

---

## VARIANT CLASS IV — TRIAL-TECH PROTOTYPE

### Design Intent
- Field-deployable resonance suppression unit
- Obedient, directive-bound architecture
- Replace judgment with command execution

### Observed Behavior
- Rigid posture
- Harsh linear resonance output
- Zero adaptability
- Escalates suppression under uncertainty

### Failure Mode
**Directive escalation spiral**

When directives conflict with reality:
- suppression intensifies
- harm increases
- system cannot de-escalate

### Narrative Function
Use when you need:
- institutional violence made visible
- procedural harm
- proof that obedience is not safety

## SHARED LIMITATIONS (CANON LOCK)

All Manufactured Meta variants:

- lack Intent
- cannot self-correct emotionally
- collapse under sustained emotional complexity
- destabilize environments rather than integrating

No variant ever:
- stabilizes long-term
- evolves beyond its design premise
- achieves autonomy

---

## ESCALATION GUIDELINES

Early Neon:
- subtle failures
- classified incidents
- localized instability

Mid-Neon:
- public breakdowns
- visible harm
- institutional panic

Loom:
- reuse of broken designs
- catastrophic collapse
- final proof of impossibility

---

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY NOTE

Each variant answers the same question differently:

> *What if we remove one more human variable?*

Every answer is wrong.
