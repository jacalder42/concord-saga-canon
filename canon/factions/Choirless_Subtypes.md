# THE CHOIRLESS — SUBTYPES  
Faction Appendix • Behavioral Expressions of Doctrine  
Neon → Loom Escalation Patterns

---

## PURPOSE

This file defines the **primary behavioral subtypes** through which the Choirless ideology manifests in the world.

These subtypes are:
- not organizations
- not leaders
- not characters

They are **patterns of collective behavior** that emerge from the same core doctrine under different trauma conditions.

Use this file to:
- select the correct Choirless expression for a scene
- vary threat texture without inventing new factions
- escalate Neon → Loom pressure organically
- ground crowd behavior in psychology rather than plot convenience

---

## CORE DOCTRINE (SHARED)

All Choirless subtypes believe:

- emotion is the source of suffering  
- silence prevents harm  
- calm is moral good  
- empathy prolongs pain  

Subtypes differ only in **how** that belief is enacted.

---

## SUBTYPE I — THE QUIETISTS

### Core State
**Fear exhaustion**

### Defining Belief
> *“If everything is quiet, nothing can hurt us.”*

### Behavioral Signature
- soft voices or silence
- synchronized stillness
- gentle physical proximity
- ritualized calming gestures
- visible discomfort around emotional expression

Quietists do not confront.  
They **dampen**.

---

### Methods
- crowd quieting
- tone suppression
- calming rituals
- guided stillness
- social pressure toward silence

Violence, when it occurs, is:
- indirect
- framed as “help”
- often invisible in the moment

---

### Visual & Sensory Markers
- pale or muted clothing
- soft, diffuse lighting
- minimal contrast
- reduced motion
- sound feels absorbed or muffled

---

### Narrative Use
Use Quietists when:
- trauma saturation is high
- people are emotionally exhausted
- silence feels like relief
- harm is subtle but profound

They are most effective in:
- hospitals
- shelters
- transit hubs
- recovery zones
- post-disaster interiors

---

### Failure Mode
Quietists fail when:
- suppressed emotion resurfaces explosively
- silence amplifies distress rather than containing it
- empathy stabilizes faster than calm

---

## SUBTYPE II — THE LEVELERS

### Core State
**Fear weaponized**

### Defining Belief
> *“Strong feelings endanger everyone. Remove them.”*

### Behavioral Signature
- rigid synchronization
- enforcement of uniform behavior
- zero tolerance for emotional deviation
- visible hostility toward expressive individuals
- moral absolutism

Levelers do not soothe.  
They **erase**.

---

### Methods
- forced emotional suppression
- punitive quieting
- removal of “disruptive” individuals
- ritualized enforcement
- intimidation framed as protection

Violence is:
- justified
- procedural
- framed as necessary containment

---

### Visual & Sensory Markers
- stark palettes (white, gray, red accents)
- rigid posture
- sharp, angular movement
- staccato sound environments
- harsh lighting

---

### Narrative Use
Use Levelers when:
- fear is active and politicized
- crowds demand action
- absolutism has social legitimacy
- the Choirless are most overtly antagonistic

They dominate:
- street actions
- checkpoints
- rallies
- public confrontations

---

### Failure Mode
Levelers fail when:
- their rigidity triggers backlash
- enforcement escalates fear rather than reducing it
- chaos outpaces control

---

## SUBTYPE III — THE BEREAVED

### Core State
**Unprocessed grief**

### Defining Belief
> *“Feeling is unbearable. I cannot survive it again.”*

### Behavioral Signature
- flat affect
- dissociation
- emotional withdrawal
- quiet desperation
- susceptibility to guidance

The Bereaved do not lead.  
They **follow**.

---

### Methods
- voluntary emotional nullification
- acceptance of quieting measures
- withdrawal from expressive spaces
- passive reinforcement of doctrine

Their harm is:
- inward
- self-erasing
- cumulative

---

### Visual & Sensory Markers
- hollow expressions
- muted grays and washed tones
- slow or absent movement
- environments feel emptied
- sound feels distant

---

### Narrative Use
Use the Bereaved when:
- you need human cost without spectacle
- to show how ideology recruits
- to ground the Choirless in real suffering
- to create moral pressure on protagonists

They are common in:
- refugee populations
- aftermath zones
- long-term collapse spaces

---

### Failure Mode
The Bereaved fail (recover) when:
- emotional connection re-emerges safely
- grief is witnessed without escalation
- empathy proves survivable

---

## SUBTYPE INTERACTIONS (IMPORTANT)

- **Ito Masayuki** amplifies **Levelers**
- **Saeko Morita** stabilizes **Quietists**
- **Bereaved** supply the emotional fuel for both

These subtypes can:
- coexist in the same space
- transition between each other
- mutate as pressure increases

Escalation path (typical):
