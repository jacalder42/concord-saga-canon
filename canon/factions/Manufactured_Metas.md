# MANUFACTURED METAS  
Faction Canon • Engineered Antagonist Class  
Human-Made Resonance Failures • Intent-Absent Constructs

---

## FACTION FUNCTION

Manufactured Metas are **engineered beings created to simulate or replace resonance without emotion or Intent**.

They are not villains.
They are **evidence**.

Their role in the saga is to demonstrate that:
- resonance without Intent is unstable
- power without empathy collapses
- systems built to bypass humanity fail catastrophically
- human fear, not metaphysics, is the true antagonist

Manufactured Metas exist to prove a negative:
> *You cannot remove emotion from resonance and expect coherence.*

---

## WHAT MANUFACTURED METAS ARE

Manufactured Metas are:
- artificial constructs (biological, cybernetic, or hybrid)
- designed by human institutions under pressure
- created to control, isolate, or weaponize resonance
- permanently **incapable of Intent**

They may:
- mimic emotional behavior
- approximate resonance output
- display pattern recognition or learning

They can **never**:
- develop Intent
- ascend
- stabilize long-term
- integrate into the Breathable Veil

---

## WHAT MANUFACTURED METAS ARE NOT

They are not:
- a culture
- a belief system
- a population
- a movement
- a metaphysical species

They do not organize.
They do not recruit.
They do not evolve ideologically.

They **fail mechanically**.

---

## ORIGIN CONDITIONS

Manufactured Metas emerge when:

- Dominions suppress hybrid knowledge  
- Technarc seeks predictive control  
- Hardliners attempt resonance sterilization  
- Institutions refuse emotional unpredictability  

They are born from:
- fear of hybrids
- distrust of empathy
- belief that resonance can be engineered like software

Their creation is always framed as **necessity**.

---

## CORE DESIGN ERROR (CANON LOCK)

**Resonance requires Intent.**

Intent is not:
- willpower
- intelligence
- obedience
- programming

Intent is:
- emotional alignment + agency + choice

Manufactured Metas lack this permanently.

This is not a bug.
It is the **inevitable outcome** of their design premise.

---

## BEHAVIORAL PROFILE (GENERAL)

Manufactured Metas typically exhibit:
- high resonance output
- unstable pattern feedback
- emotional mimicry without grounding
- escalating failure under pressure
- unpredictable collapse behaviors

They often appear:
- eerily calm
- mechanically precise
- emotionally “off”
- increasingly erratic over time

The more power they display, the closer they are to failure.

## TRILOGY ROLE & ESCALATION

### VEIL
- Early prototypes
- Classified failures
- Suppressed data
- Rumors and isolated incidents

### NEON
- Field deployment
- Public exposure
- Catastrophic breakdowns
- Proof that institutional control is failing

### LOOM
- Legacy debris
- Panic-driven reuse of flawed designs
- Final confirmation of impossibility

Manufactured Metas do not survive Loom intact.

---

## THEMATIC FUNCTION

Manufactured Metas embody:
- intelligence without wisdom
- power without humanity
- control without consent
- fear mistaken for innovation

They force the saga to answer:
> *If resonance requires being human, what happens when we try to remove humanity from the equation?*

---

## CANON LOCKS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Entirely human-made
- No supernatural origin
- No Intent, ever
- No ascension
- No redemption arc
- No stable long-term existence

Individual Metas may evoke sympathy.  
The system that created them is the antagonist.

---

## USAGE GUIDELINES

Use Manufactured Metas when:
- you need visible proof of institutional failure
- resonance power must feel wrong or brittle
- antagonism should be tragic, not malicious
- consequences of fear-driven design must be undeniable

Do **not**:
- give them ideology
- give them POV
- frame them as the “real villains”

They are the warning, not the cause.
