# CONCORD  
## Era Function — Veil / Neon / Loom

**Purpose:** Define how Concord operates differently as systemic pressure escalates,  
while preserving its mandate, limits, and ethical constraints.

Concord adapts operationally —  
it does not evolve ideologically.

---

## I. ERA PRINCIPLE (CANON)

Concord is **reactive**, not visionary.

It never gets ahead of collapse.
It only responds when failure is already in motion.

Across eras:
- its scope widens
- its strain increases
- its legitimacy becomes harder to maintain

---

## II. VEIL ERA — PRE-COALITION STATE

### Operating Context
- Institutions largely functional
- Resonance instability rare and deniable
- Crises framed as isolated incidents
- International cooperation still bureaucratic

### Concord Status
Concord does **not yet exist** as a named coalition.

Instead:
- ad hoc multinational task forces
- humanitarian corridors
- joint disaster-response agreements
- limited intelligence sharing

These are precursors, not Concord.

---

### Narrative Use
Use pre-Concord activity in Veil to:
- show how close cooperation almost works
- foreshadow the need for something more flexible
- contrast later Concord actions with earlier hesitation

Failure here is **delay**, not malice.

---

## III. NEON ERA — ACTIVE COALITION

### Operating Context
- Resonance events frequent and public
- Institutional failure accelerates
- Mass displacement begins
- Extremist ideologies gain traction

### Concord Function
In Neon, Concord **fully emerges**.

Primary roles:
- rapid response to resonance disasters
- corridor stabilization and evacuation
- civilian extraction from collapse zones
- mediation between failing authorities

Concord becomes visible —  
and therefore controversial.

---

### Strains in Neon
- accusations of overreach
- uneven consent from governments
- competition with Technarc frameworks
- ideological pressure from Dominions
- hostility from Choirless-aligned zones

Concord survives by **withdrawing early**, not staying strong.

---

### Narrative Use
Use Concord in Neon to:
- prevent worst-case collapse
- show limits of organized response
- create tension with Filaments
- illustrate moral cost of intervention

Success is measured in **lives moved**, not crises ended.

---

## IV. LOOM ERA — FRACTURED NECESSITY

### Operating Context
- Global institutional collapse
- Corridor instability widespread
- Resonance storms and hinge-zone failures
- No reliable global authority

### Concord Function
In Loom, Concord fragments.

It persists as:
- independent regional cells
- legacy-trained operators
- shared ethical memory rather than command

Its core mandate remains:
> Buy time. Reduce harm. Get out.

---

### Limits in Loom (CRITICAL)
Concord cannot:
- hold territory
- govern populations
- suppress ideologies
- counter large-scale violence alone

It can only:
- slow collapse locally
- create survival windows
- protect evacuations
- prevent total isolation

This is where Filaments become essential.

---

### Failure Modes in Loom
- exhaustion
- moral injury
- loss of legitimacy
- withdrawal under impossible pressure

Concord does not fall heroically.
It **thins out**.

---

## V. POST-MENDING STATUS (REFERENCE)

After the Mending:
- Concord dissolves as a formal coalition
- some practices persist in local governance
- operators return to civilian life

No monument.
No continuation mandate.
No new authority.

Concord ends because it is no longer needed.

---

## VI. CANON LOCKS

- Concord does not become permanent
- It never controls post-Mending society
- It does not transition into governance
- It does not outlive the crisis it was built for

---

## VII. THEMATIC STATEMENT

Across every era, Concord answers the same question:

> *How do you act when action itself risks becoming harm?*

Its answer is imperfect, temporary, and human —
and that is why it matters.
