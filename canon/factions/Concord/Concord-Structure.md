# CONCORD  
## Tier-2 Structure & Operational Model Canon

**Purpose:** Define how Concord operates in practice while remaining limited, accountable, and non-authoritarian.

Concord is structured to **act**, not to rule.

---

## I. STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLE (CANON)

Concord is **modular, temporary, and consent-driven**.

It is designed to:
- assemble quickly
- act locally
- dissolve cleanly
- leave minimal footprint

Any structure that cannot dissolve has failed its mandate.

---

## II. ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL

Concord operates as a **network of cells**, not a hierarchy.

### Core Characteristics
- Small, semi-autonomous teams
- Mission-specific assembly
- No permanent command chain
- Leadership assigned by expertise, not rank
- Authority expires with the mission

There is coordination —  
but no standing command authority.

---

## III. OPERATIONAL LAYERS

Concord functions across three overlapping layers:

---

### 1. FIELD TEAMS (PRIMARY)

**Function:** Immediate harm reduction

- Evacuation
- Stabilization
- Corridor protection
- Civilian extraction
- Emergency mediation

**Composition:**
- logistics specialists
- medical responders
- local guides
- technical operators
- Filament liaisons (when possible)

Field teams act fast and leave faster.

---

### 2. COORDINATION NODES (SECONDARY)

**Function:** Synchronization, not control

- Share intelligence
- Deconflict operations
- Allocate scarce resources
- Maintain corridor maps

Nodes do not issue orders.
They **facilitate coherence**.

---

### 3. LIAISON & ACCOUNTABILITY UNITS

**Function:** Ethical and emotional oversight

- Civilian interface
- Filament coordination
- Post-operation review
- Withdrawal timing assessment

These units exist to say:
> *“We should not be here anymore.”*

---

## IV. DECISION-MAKING LOGIC

Concord decision-making follows a **triage ethic**:

1. Civilian harm prevention
2. Corridor viability
3. Team survivability
4. Political consequences (last)

If these priorities invert, Concord has lost its mandate.

---

## V. RELATIONSHIP TO LOCAL AUTHORITY

Concord:
- defers to local governance when functional
- supports without replacing
- withdraws when consent is revoked

If Concord is asked to govern:
- it must refuse
- or fragment

Concord is not designed to rule.

---

## VI. RESOURCE MODEL

Concord does not own territory or industry.

Resources are:
- borrowed
- donated
- repurposed
- abandoned after use

No permanent infrastructure.
No extraction economy.
No long-term dependency.

---

## VII. COMMUNICATIONS & TRUST

- Transparency prioritized over secrecy
- Misinformation acknowledged openly
- Uncertainty admitted
- Overconfidence treated as risk

This makes Concord:
- slower than Dominions
- messier than Technarc
- less “clean” than Choirless logic

It also keeps it human.

---

## VIII. FAILURE CONDITIONS (STRUCTURAL)

Concord fails structurally when:
- missions become permanent
- teams stop rotating
- authority stops expiring
- secrecy replaces accountability
- Filament input is ignored

These failures precede moral collapse.

---

## IX. CANON LOCKS

- No standing army
- No supreme commander
- No sovereign authority
- No ideological enforcement
- No permanent headquarters

Concord exists only **between crises**.

---

## X. THEMATIC STATEMENT

Concord’s structure answers a single question:

> *How do you act decisively without claiming the right to decide forever?*

The answer is **temporary authority, constantly questioned**.
