# CONCORD  
## Interfaction Relationships Canon

**Purpose:** Define how Concord relates to other major factions without eclipsing them, absorbing them, or becoming an ideological center.

Concord does not dominate the ecosystem.  
It moves through it under pressure.

---

## I. RELATIONAL PRINCIPLE (CANON)

Concord’s relationships are defined by **constraint**, not alignment.

It is tolerated, resisted, resented, relied upon, and criticized —
often simultaneously.

Concord is never universally trusted.

---

## II. CONCORD ↔ FILAMENTS (FOUNDATIONAL)

### Dependency
Concord depends on Filaments for:
- civilian legitimacy
- emotional ground truth
- early warning of collapse
- post-intervention stabilization

Without Filaments:
- Concord interventions escalate harm
- evacuations fracture communities
- corridors destabilize faster

---

### Tension
Filaments distrust Concord when:
- operations move too fast
- extraction overrides community consent
- mission success is prioritized over human cost

Filaments respond not with rebellion, but withdrawal.

---

### Canon Lock
Concord never commands Filaments.  
Filaments never answer to Concord.

Their cooperation is **earned, not assumed**.

---

## III. CONCORD ↔ DOMINIONS

### Dominion Stance
- View Concord as destabilizing
- Accuse it of undermining order
- Attempt to restrict access and legitimacy

Dominions fear Concord’s transparency.

---

### Concord Response
- Avoid direct confrontation
- Circumvent rather than oppose
- Protect civilians quietly
- Withdraw before escalation

Concord does not challenge Dominion authority head-on.
It makes it **irrelevant locally**.

---

## IV. CONCORD ↔ TECHNARC

### Technarc Stance
- Sees Concord as inefficient
- Prefers predictive, centralized solutions
- Frames Concord as emotionally compromised

Technarc seeks to replace Concord with systems.

---

### Concord Response
- Rejects emotional sterilization
- Accepts uncertainty
- Prioritizes adaptability over optimization

This relationship is a quiet ideological clash:
> optimization vs humanity

---

## V. CONCORD ↔ MANUFACTURED METAS

### Interaction
- Concord treats metas as containment risks, not enemies
- Prioritizes civilian evacuation over Meta neutralization
- Views metas as proof of institutional failure

Concord does not deploy metas.
It cleans up after them.

---

## VI. CONCORD ↔ CHOIRLESS

### Choirless Stance
- Reject Concord as chaotic and permissive
- Accuse it of enabling emotional harm
- Target Concord corridors for suppression

Choirless doctrine frames Concord as irresponsible.

---

### Concord Response
- Avoid ideological confrontation
- Focus on extraction and withdrawal
- Refuse to enforce silence

This conflict is **irreconcilable**.

---

## VII. CONCORD ↔ BRIGHTBREAK

### Brightbreak Stance
- Exploits Concord’s moral ambiguity
- Reframes interventions as manipulative
- Uses uncertainty to build narrative certainty

Brightbreak feeds on Concord’s limits.

---

### Concord Response
- Limited capacity to counter narratives
- Relies on transparency and withdrawal
- Loses public trust faster than it can rebuild it

This asymmetry is intentional.

---

## VIII. CONCORD ↔ CIVILIANS

### Civilian Perception
Concord is seen as:
- lifesaving by some
- invasive by others
- insufficient by many
- frightening by those left behind

No unified opinion exists.

---

### Canon Lock
Concord does not seek to be loved.
It seeks to **do less harm**.

---

## IX. FAILURE SIGNALS (RELATIONAL)

Concord has failed relationally when:
- Filaments refuse contact
- civilians hide rather than approach
- Dominions no longer feel threatened
- Technarc absorbs its functions
- Brightbreak narratives dominate uncontested

These signals precede collapse.

---

## X. THEMATIC STATEMENT

Concord exists in a narrow corridor:

> *Too little action is abandonment.  
> Too much action is domination.*

It survives only by walking that line —
and it often stumbles.
