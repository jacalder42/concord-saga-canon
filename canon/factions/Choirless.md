# THE CHOIRLESS  
Extremist Faction Canon  
Trauma-Born Absolutists • Emotional Erasure Doctrine • Neon-Era Antagonists

---

## FACTION FUNCTION

The Choirless represent **humanity’s attempt to survive trauma by eliminating feeling itself**.

They are not created by ideology alone.
They are born from:
- mass trauma
- institutional failure
- fear exhaustion
- the belief that emotion is the source of suffering

Their role in the saga is to demonstrate how:
- trauma radicalizes ordinary people
- silence becomes seductive after catastrophe
- extremism can feel like relief
- emotional erasure masquerades as peace

The Choirless are an **extremist faction**, not a governing body.

---

## CORE DOCTRINE

**Emotion is Entropy**  
**Silence is Survival**  
**Calm is the Only Mercy**

The Choirless believe:
- feeling perpetuates suffering
- grief spreads instability
- empathy prolongs pain
- silence ends the cycle

Their defining belief:
> *If no one feels, no one can be hurt.*

This doctrine reframes emotional nullification as compassion.

---

## ORIGIN CONDITIONS

The Choirless emerge in **Neon**, after:
- large-scale resonance disasters
- visible institutional collapse
- failure of Dominions and Technarc to protect civilians
- widespread emotional burnout

They are not organized at first.
They **coalesce**.

Fear precedes doctrine.

---

## IDEOLOGICAL AXES (IMPORTANT)

The Choirless are shaped by **two complementary influences**:

### ITO MASAYUKI — FEAR AMPLIFIER
- Public voice of trauma absolutism
- Turns fear into certainty
- Validates rage and exhaustion
- Makes emotional erasure feel *necessary*

Ito does not design the Choirless.  
He **gives them permission**.

---

### SAEKO MORITA — SERENITY ENGINEER
- Designs calm as doctrine
- Refines silence into care
- Removes cruelty from extremism
- Makes erasure feel *gentle*

Saeko does not rally the Choirless.  
She **stabilizes them**.

---

## INTERNAL FACTION DYNAMICS

The Choirless are not monolithic.

They include:
- the frightened
- the exhausted
- the ideologically rigid
- the trauma-numbed

Common traits:
- flat affect
- ritualized calm
- distrust of empathy
- hostility toward emotional expression

They do not see themselves as violent.
They see themselves as **preventative**.

---

## METHODS & PRACTICES

### Behavioral
- synchronized movement
- controlled speech or silence
- suppression of visible emotion
- ritualized calm enforcement

### Ideological
- framing empathy as harm
- labeling emotion as contagion
- redefining resistance as instability

### Tactical
- crowd quieting
- emotional suppression tools
- PureTone logic adoption
- indirect violence through erasure

Their harm is **quiet and collective**.

---

## VISUAL & BEHAVIORAL SIGNATURE

### Visual
- pale or muted palettes
- minimal contrast
- uniform motion
- masks or neutral coverings in later stages

### Behavioral
- synchronized stillness
- reduced vocalization
- calm responses to distress
- discomfort with expressive individuals

They erase difference to create peace.

---

## TRILOGY ROLE & EVOLUTION

### NEON ERA
- Primary extremist antagonist faction
- Violence framed as quieting
- Emotional expression treated as threat
- First overt attempts at emotional nullification

The Choirless believe they are saving the world.

---

### LOOM ERA
- Fragmentation and mutation
- Doctrine reused by panic regimes
- Quiet policies enacted at scale
- Emotional erasure reframed as crisis response

The Choirless no longer need a name.
Their logic persists.

---

## FAILURE MODES

The Choirless fail when:
- suppressed emotion erupts catastrophically
- silence amplifies rather than contains pain
- empathy stabilizes groups faster than quiet
- people choose to feel despite fear

They cannot survive sustained emotional literacy.

---

## CANON LOCKS

- Entirely human
- Trauma-born, not metaphysical
- No utopian success
- No moral correctness
- No redemption arc as a faction

Individual members may recover.
The ideology does not.

---

## USAGE GUIDELINES (IMPORTANT)

Use the Choirless in scenes only when:
- trauma saturation is high
- fear exhaustion dominates
- harm is framed as calm intervention
- violence is indirect and ideological

If a scene requires:
- spectacle
- chaos
- emotional expression

The Choirless should appear as **antagonistic pressure**, not active agents.

---

## THEMATIC ROLE

The Choirless force the saga to confront the question:

> *If feeling hurts, is the answer to stop feeling — or to learn how to carry pain together?*

They embody:
- trauma mistaken for wisdom
- peace mistaken for silence
- care without consent
- survival stripped of humanity
