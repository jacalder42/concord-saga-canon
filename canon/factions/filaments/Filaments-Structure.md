# THE FILAMENTS  
## Tier-2 Structure & Roles Canon

**Classification:** Cultural Function Network  
**Structure Type:** Decentralized · Role-Based · Non-Hierarchical  
**Authority Model:** Situational Trust, Not Command

---

## I. STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW

The Filaments have **no leadership hierarchy**.

They do not issue orders.
They do not enforce doctrine.
They do not coordinate globally.

Instead, they operate through **recognized roles** that emerge naturally inside communities under emotional pressure.

These roles are:
- functional, not symbolic
- situational, not permanent
- culturally adaptive
- often overlapping in the same person

A Filament role exists only as long as it is **needed and trusted**.

---

## II. ROLE MODEL (CORE PRINCIPLE)

Filament roles follow one rule:

> **Authority comes from presence, not position.**

A person is recognized as holding a role because:
- others defer to them in moments of pressure
- they stabilize rather than escalate
- they make space rather than take it
- they are consistently reliable under stress

When that trust breaks, the role dissolves.

---

## III. PRIMARY FILAMENT ROLES

These are **archetypal functions**, not titles.  
Names vary by culture; functions do not.

---

---

## IV. SECONDARY / EMERGENT ROLES

Depending on culture and need, additional functions may appear:

- **The Keeper of Space** — manages physical/emotional safety of locations
- **The Caller** — brings people together at the right moment
- **The Mediator** — de-escalates conflict between factions or families
- **The Carrier** — physically moves people, supplies, or stories

These are **expressions**, not permanent roles.

---

## V. ROLE FLUIDITY (IMPORTANT)

One person may:
- hold multiple roles
- shift roles across time
- relinquish roles without ceremony

Filaments reject fixed identity.
What matters is **what the moment requires**.

This is why Filaments cannot be institutionalized.

---

## VI. WHY FILAMENTS RESIST CO-OPTING

Filaments fail when:
- roles are formalized
- authority is codified
- emotional labor becomes policy
- trust is replaced by mandate

This is the core reason:
- Dominions fear them
- Technarc dismisses them
- Choirless oppose them
- Brightbreak exploits them

Filaments cannot be weaponized without being destroyed.

---

## VII. RELATIONSHIP TO CONCORD (PREVIEW)

Concord does not create Filament roles.
It depends on them.

When Concord forgets this:
- missions fail
- civilians resist
- emotional collapse follows

Concord is strongest when it listens.

(This relationship will be fully defined in the Concord files.)

---

## VIII. CANON LOCKS

- Filament roles are never ranked
- No global council exists
- No one “becomes” a Filament formally
- Roles dissolve when trust dissolves
- Cultural variation is expected

---

## IX. THEMATIC STATEMENT

Filaments prove that leadership does not require command,
and care does not require control.

They are how humanity survives **between systems**.
