# THE FILAMENTS  
## Tier-2 Era Function — Veil / Neon / Loom

**Purpose:** Define how Filaments operate differently as resonance pressure escalates,  
without changing their ethos, authority model, or human-scale limits.

---

## I. ERA PRINCIPLE (CANON)

Filaments **do not evolve ideologically** across eras.

What changes is:
- environmental pressure
- resonance visibility
- scale of trauma
- institutional failure rate

Filaments adapt through **practice**, not doctrine.

---

## II. VEIL ERA — INVISIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE

### Operating Context
- Resonance subtle or unrecognized
- Institutions still largely functional
- Trauma localized, episodic
- Emotional crises framed as personal, not systemic

### Filament Function
In Veil, Filaments are **invisible**.

They appear as:
- neighborhood elders
- crisis-capable civilians
- informal care networks
- cultural memory holders

They are not named.
They are not tracked.
They are not coordinated.

---

### Primary Roles in Veil
- Rootkeepers dominate
- Witnesses appear during tragedy
- Sparkbrokers surface only briefly

### Narrative Use
Use Filaments in Veil to:
- ground characters emotionally
- explain quiet resilience
- contrast with Dominion secrecy
- foreshadow later resonance awareness

They stabilize without recognition.

---

## III. NEON ERA — EMERGING PATTERN

### Operating Context
- Resonance becomes visible and destabilizing
- Institutions fracture under pressure
- Trauma scales from local to regional
- Public fear accelerates

### Filament Function
In Neon, Filaments **become legible**.

They do not organize —  
but people begin to notice the pattern.

Filaments:
- coordinate implicitly
- share techniques informally
- cross cultural boundaries
- adapt faster than institutions

---

### Primary Roles in Neon
- Sparkbrokers become critical
- Witnesses scale dramatically
- Rootkeepers anchor collapsing communities

### Interaction with Antagonists
- **Choirless:** direct ideological opposition
- **Technarc:** dismissed as inefficient
- **Brightbreak:** partially parasitized
- **Dominions:** quietly undermined

---

### Narrative Use
Use Filaments in Neon to:
- prevent total collapse
- show humanity adapting without power
- create friction with authoritarian solutions
- justify why some places survive longer

They become **quiet resistance**.

---

## IV. LOOM ERA — LAST HUMAN NET

### Operating Context
- Global institutional collapse
- Resonance storms and corridor instability
- Mass displacement and grief saturation
- No reliable authority

### Filament Function
In Loom, Filaments are **essential**.

They do not replace institutions —  
they become the **only remaining connective tissue**.

They:
- regulate panic
- hold grief at scale
- preserve cultural identity
- prevent total social atomization

---

### Primary Roles in Loom
- Witnesses are everywhere
- Rootkeepers stabilize survival zones
- Sparkbrokers manage movement and transition

Roles often overlap due to necessity.

---

### Limits in Loom (IMPORTANT)
Filaments cannot:
- stop large-scale violence alone
- enforce safety
- manage logistics at scale
- counter militarized forces

They can only:
- keep people human
- prevent emotional collapse
- preserve memory

This is why Concord must exist.

---

## V. POST-MENDING (REFERENCE ONLY)

After the Mending:
- Filaments do not disappear
- They recede back into cultural normalcy
- Their work becomes less visible again

They are not replaced.
They are **relieved**.

---

## VI. FAILURE MODES BY ERA

### Veil
- Ignored
- Overlooked
- Unsupported

### Neon
- Overwhelmed
- Co-opted
- Targeted by extremists

### Loom
- Exhausted
- Lost to attrition
- Forced into impossible scale

Filaments fail through **overload**, not corruption.

---

## VII. CANON LOCKS

- Filaments never become a governing body
- They never “win” alone
- They do not scale infinitely
- Their success is survival, not victory

---

## VIII. THEMATIC STATEMENT

Across every era, Filaments answer the same question:

> *How do humans remain human when systems fail?*

They do not solve collapse.
They **carry people through it**.
