# THE FILAMENTS  
## Canon Locks & Failure Modes

**Purpose:** Define the absolute boundaries of the Filaments so they remain human-scale, narratively honest, and mechanically consistent across all trilogies and expansions.

This file is a **hard guardrail**.

---

## I. CANON LOCK PRINCIPLE

Filaments are powerful **only because they are limited**.

If they ever:
- solve collapse alone
- replace institutions
- scale infinitely
- become symbolic saviors

They have broken canon.

---

## II. ABSOLUTE CANON LOCKS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The following rules may **never** be violated:

### 1. Filaments Are Entirely Human
- No metaphysical abilities
- No resonance manipulation
- No hidden Veil access
- No post-Mending elevation

They succeed through presence, not power.

---

### 2. Filaments Cannot Centralize
- No councils
- No leadership hierarchy
- No global coordination
- No unified doctrine

Any attempt at formalization destroys them.

---

### 3. Filaments Cannot Command
- They do not give orders
- They do not enforce compliance
- They do not override consent

Influence without consent is not Filament behavior.

---

### 4. Filaments Cannot Be Weaponized
- They cannot be used tactically
- They cannot be deployed
- They cannot be scaled by force

When others attempt this, Filaments withdraw or break.

---

### 5. Filaments Do Not “Win”
- They do not defeat antagonists
- They do not end ideologies
- They do not stop violence directly

Their success metric is **survival with humanity intact**.

---

## III. FAILURE MODES (CRITICAL)

Filaments fail in predictable, human ways.

---

### FAILURE MODE A — OVERLOAD

**Cause:**
- prolonged crisis
- insufficient rest
- too many people relying on too few holders

**Symptoms:**
- emotional numbing
- withdrawal
- dissociation
- role collapse

**Narrative Signal:**
Communities lose their emotional anchors.

---

### FAILURE MODE B — CO-OPTATION

**Cause:**
- institutional appropriation
- ideological exploitation
- narrative predation (Brightbreak)

**Symptoms:**
- language hollowing
- care rituals becoming performative
- loss of trust

**Narrative Signal:**
People feel “managed,” not held.

---

### FAILURE MODE C — SUPPRESSION

**Cause:**
- authoritarian intervention
- Choirless enforcement
- Dominion or Technarc exclusion

**Symptoms:**
- silence without consent
- fear-driven compliance
- hidden grief accumulation

**Narrative Signal:**
Resonance pressure spikes later, not sooner.

---

### FAILURE MODE D — EXHAUSTION THROUGH SCALE

**Cause:**
- Loom-level collapse
- mass displacement
- unrelenting grief density

**Symptoms:**
- role blending without recovery
- loss of Witness capacity
- Sparkbroker misfires
- Rootkeeper burnout

**Narrative Signal:**
Humanity frays even where people survive.

---

## IV. WHAT FILAMENT FAILURE DOES (IMPORTANT)

Filament failure does **not** mean:
- immediate violence
- instant collapse
- antagonist victory

It means:
- humanity becomes brittle
- extremism gains traction
- Concord loses legitimacy
- Brightbreak narratives spread
- Choirless doctrine feels tempting

Failure creates **vulnerability**, not apocalypse.

---

## V. RELATIONSHIP TO CONCORD (LOCK)

Filaments:
- legitimize Concord morally
- ground Concord emotionally
- constrain Concord ethically

If Concord ignores Filaments:
- missions succeed tactically
- outcomes fail humanly

Concord cannot replace Filaments.
Filaments cannot replace Concord.

Their balance is essential.

---

## VI. POST-MENDING STATUS (LOCK)

After the Mending:
- Filaments persist
- They become less visible
- Their work returns to cultural normalcy

They are not celebrated.
They are **relieved**.

The world is quieter because it no longer needs them at full strain.

---

## VII. DESIGN INTENT (META)

This file exists to protect against:
- power creep
- mythologizing care
- turning empathy into magic
- replacing systems with sentiment

The Filaments are meaningful **because they are not spectacular**.

---

## VIII. THEMATIC FINAL STATEMENT

The Filaments answer the saga’s most important question:

> *What remains when power fails?*

The answer is not strength.
It is not control.
It is not certainty.

It is **people, holding each other, imperfectly, anyway**.
