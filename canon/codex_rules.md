# Codex Rules (Project Governance)

- Emotional truth > spectacle
- Metaphysics must serve character
- All supplements must serve story
- No lazy magic; resonance remains grounded
- Characters remain flawed, human, and aware
- Breadth of worldbuilding must never overshadow emotional core
- Serialization requires micro-payoffs; novels require macro-payoffs
- Tone must remain consistent with author DNA
- Canon > intention once locked
