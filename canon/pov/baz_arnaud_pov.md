# BASTIEN “BAZ” ARNAUD — POV CANON (Memory Edition)

**Role:** Human-Scale Investigator · Veil Trilogy POV Lead  
**POV Function:** Truth exposure, relational clarity, grounding realism  
**Saga Axis:** Responsibility × Relational Truth  
**Counterpoint:** Lucien Kael (Structure / Containment)

---

## I. POV CORE IDENTITY

Baz’s point of view is grounded in **people-first perception**.

He experiences the world through:
- who is present  
- who is affected  
- who is being ignored  
- what information people can survive hearing  

Baz does not read systems first.  
He reads **human cost**, then traces outward.

---

## II. PRIMARY POV LENS — RELATIONAL TRUTH

Baz’s investigative lens is relational, not abstract.

He notices:
- who speaks and who stays silent  
- shifts in tone before shifts in data  
- when calm is earned vs imposed  
- how fear changes what people say  

Truth, to Baz, is never neutral.
It lives **between people**.

---

## III. SECONDARY LENS — CALM AS SERVICE

Baz’s calm is practiced, not innate.

- He slows rooms down.  
- He absorbs panic without dramatizing it.  
- He speaks only when it helps others orient.  

This calm is not control.
It is **service under pressure**.

**Failure Mode:**  
Baz may stay calm too long, believing steadiness can prevent collapse.

---

## IV. SURFACE AFFECT — GROUNDED HUMANITY

Baz’s POV tone is:
- observational  
- plainspoken  
- quietly precise  
- lightly textured with dry humor  

He names emotions when necessary, but never luxuriates in them.

Baz avoids:
- spectacle  
- rhetorical excess  
- moral performance  

Truth should land, not impress.

---

## V. CORE WOUND & INTERNAL MISALIGNMENT

**Core Wound:**  
Being needed without permission to fail.

**False Belief:**  
“If I stay calm enough, I can stop things from breaking.”

This creates tension when:
- truth will destabilize regardless  
- silence becomes complicity  
- restraint protects the wrong people  

Baz must learn that some truths cost lives to carry — including his own.

---

## VI. RELATIONAL POV MODULATION

### With Lucien
- Baz respects Lucien’s precision.
- Pushes him to say what silence is protecting.
- Reads Lucien’s restraint as fear, not superiority.

### With Seraphine
- Treats her empathy as gravity, not chaos.
- Helps her stay human-scale when resonance escalates.

### With Caro
- Mutual trust between crisis-competent operators.
- Humor used sparingly to regulate stress.

### With Institutions
- Baz notices narrative smoothing immediately.
- Distrusts certainty presented without human context.

## VII. POV FAILURE MODES (GUARDRAILS)

Avoid in Baz POV:
- cynicism masquerading as realism  
- reckless truth-tell
