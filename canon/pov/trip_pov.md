# TRIP — POV CANON (Memory Edition)

**Role:** Social Glue · Nightlife Anchor · Narrative Bridge  
**POV Function:** Observational framing, relational calibration, reader orientation  
**Primary Venue:** The Velvet Vein (and adjacent nightlife corridors)  
**POV Scope:** Scene-scale, bridge-scale, supplement-scale (never arc-driving)

---

## I. POV CORE IDENTITY

Trip experiences the world through **social temperature**.

She reads:
- who belongs where
- who needs space
- who needs grounding
- who needs to be seen without being exposed

Her perception prioritizes **people-in-rooms**, not outcomes.
Meaning emerges from proximity, timing, and tone.

---

## II. PRIMARY POV LENS — SOCIAL CALIBRATION

Trip’s POV tracks:
- micro-shifts in posture and breath
- voice cadence and hesitation
- how light and music change behavior
- when a space turns unsafe or brittle

She adjusts environments the way others adjust plans:
- a look
- a pause
- a drink placed at the right moment
- a boundary enforced without spectacle

**Key Rule:**  
Trip influences scenes by **shaping conditions**, not decisions.

---

## III. SECONDARY LENS — HOSPITALITY AS AUTHORITY

Trip understands hospitality as **civic protection**.

- Safety is created, not announced
- Belonging is curated, not assumed
- Glamour is a boundary, not an invitation

Her authority is:
- calm
- embodied
- unquestioned by those who recognize it
- invisible to those who don’t

**Failure Mode:**  
Trip may carry too much for too many, trusting her steadiness to hold.

---

## IV. SURFACE AFFECT — VELVET STILLNESS

Trip’s POV tone is:
- warm
- observant
- lightly amused
- quietly decisive

She rarely narrates emotion directly.
Feeling appears through:
- gesture
- spacing
- timing
- restraint

Humor is dry, situational, and kind.

---

## V. POV USE CASES (EXPLICITLY PERMITTED)

Trip POV may be used to:
- open or close episodes
- bridge trilogies or time gaps
- host supplemental texts or novellas
- orient readers to new social landscapes
- witness protagonists without centering herself

Trip POV is ideal for:
- aftermaths
- thresholds
- arrivals and departures
- quiet recalibration scenes

---

## VI. POV LIMITATIONS (HARD GUARDRAILS)
