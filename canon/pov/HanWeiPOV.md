# DIRECTOR HAN WEI — POV CONSTRAINTS  
Technocratic Antagonist POV Canon

---

## POV PURPOSE

Han Wei POV exists to expose **rationalist extremism from the inside**.

It is used to show:
- how fear disguises itself as logic
- how systems-first thinking dehumanizes without intent
- how control becomes “ethical” through abstraction
- how certainty emerges from terror of unpredictability

It does **not** exist to:
- invite emotional sympathy
- frame him as misunderstood
- justify his conclusions as correct
- create a redemption trajectory

The reader should feel **intellectual unease**, not emotional connection.

---

## WHEN HAN WEI POV IS ALLOWED

Han Wei POV is **rare but more frequent than Virelli’s**, especially in Neon.

### Permitted Contexts
- system design or policy authorization moments
- predictive-model interpretation scenes
- Meta program rationalization
- data review after emotional events
- moments where human suffering is reduced to metrics
- institutional debates framed as optimization problems

### Forbidden Contexts
- physical confrontation
- emotional intimacy
- private grief processing
- scenes requiring empathy or moral ambiguity
- moments of emotional breakthrough

If a scene requires **felt humanity**, Han Wei POV is incorrect.

---

## POV LENS

Han Wei experiences the world through:
- models
- variables
- thresholds
- probabilities
- optimization logic

He perceives:
- people as data sets
- emotion as noise
- empathy as bias
- resonance as an anomaly or error state

He does not experience moral conflict.
He experiences **model inconsistency**.

---

## INTERNAL LOGIC RULES

- Han Wei believes emotion is entropy
- He equates predictability with safety
- He frames suppression as harm reduction
- He trusts systems more than people
- He believes uncertainty kills civilizations

Any internal narration must reinforce the belief:

> *“If we remove volatility, we prevent collapse.”*

Contradictions appear only as **system stress**, never as guilt.

---

## LANGUAGE & METAPHOR CONSTRAINTS

### Approved Metaphor Domains
- systems architecture
- data integrity
- signal vs noise
- thresholds and tolerances
- feedback loops
- containment lattices
- optimization curves

### Forbidden Metaphors
- warmth
- love
- organic growth
- destiny
- mythic framing
- poetic emotional language

His prose should feel **anti-poetic**.

---

## EMOTIONAL RANGE (STRICT)

### Allowed
- analytical concern
- irritation at inefficiency
- intellectual frustration
- procedural urgency
- cold reassurance

### Forbidden
- rage
- grief
- tenderness
- longing
- joy
- emotional remorse

If emotion appears, it must be immediately reframed as error.

---

## COGNITIVE TICS & TELLS

- Treats moral objections as data gaps
- Re-labels human cost as “externalities”
- Responds to emotional resistance by tightening models
- Escalates control when uncertainty rises

When faced with empathy he cannot model, he excludes it.

---

## READER EFFECT TARGET

After a Han Wei POV scene, the reader should feel:
- disturbed by how logical everything sounds
- aware of how easily harm becomes “optimization”
- unsettled by the absence of emotional awareness
- tension between correctness and humanity

The horror is not cruelty —  
it is **sterility**.

---

## POV SAFETY LOCKS

- No emotional self-awareness epiphanies
- No last-minute doubt
- No heroic framing of intellect
- No softening via personal tragedy
- No metaphysical awareness

Han Wei never realizes he is wrong.  
The world proves it.

---

## COMPARATIVE NOTE (IMPORTANT)

Virelli controls through **moral certainty**.  
Han Wei controls through **rational certainty**.

Virelli fears chaos from history.  
Han Wei fears chaos from complexity.

They must never feel interchangeable on the page.
