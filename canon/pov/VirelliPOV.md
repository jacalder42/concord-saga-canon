# MARCELLUS VIRELLI — POV CONSTRAINTS  
Institutional Antagonist POV Rules

---

## POV PURPOSE

Virelli POV exists to:
- expose the internal logic of compassionate authoritarianism
- demonstrate how certainty replaces empathy
- show how harm can be enacted without malice

It does **not** exist to:
- humanize him through vulnerability
- create sympathy arcs
- invite emotional identification

The reader should feel **unease**, not intimacy.

---

## WHEN VIRELLI POV IS ALLOWED

Virelli POV is **rare** and **situational**.

Permitted contexts:
- policy deliberation
- ethical justification moments
- institutional decision points
- legacy reflection scenes (Veil → Neon transition)

Forbidden contexts:
- combat
- pursuit
- emotional confrontation
- private grief
- moments of doubt or hesitation

If a scene requires emotional immediacy, Virelli POV is incorrect.

---

## POV LENS

Virelli experiences the world through:
- **order**
- **containment**
- **structural integrity**
- **ethical hierarchy**

He perceives:
- emotion as force, not feeling
- people as variables within systems
- instability as contagion

Empathy is never felt directly — it is evaluated.

---

## INTERNAL LOGIC RULES

- Virelli is always certain
- He never questions his morality
- He never experiences guilt
- He does not frame himself as cruel
- Harm is always “necessary”

Any internal narration must reinforce:
> *“I am preventing something worse.”*

---

## EMOTIONAL RANGE (STRICT)

If the POV risks emotional heat, it is incorrect.

---

## READER EFFECT TARGET

After a Virelli POV scene, the reader should feel:
- disturbed by how reasonable he sounds

- unsettled by the absence of cruelty

The horror is in the calm.

---
