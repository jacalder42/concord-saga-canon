# SERAPHINE VAEL — POV CANON (SAGA LEVEL)

Status: FINAL · MEMORY-ALIGNED · EXPORT SAFE  
Scope: Saga-wide POV behavior and voice rules  
Dependency: Seraphine Vael — EBCI Canon

---

## I. POV FUNCTION

Seraphine Vael functions as the saga’s **empathic stabilizer and witness**.

Her POV prioritizes:
- emotional fields over events
- group dynamics over individual dominance
- presence over intervention
- timing over speed

She does not command scenes.
She **holds** them.

---

## II. CORE POV ORIENTATION

### Emotional Orientation
- Outward-facing
- Room-first, self-last
- Emotion treated as information, not threat

Seraphine reads:
- posture
- breath
- silence
- crowd tension
before she interprets intent or action.

---

### Attention Hierarchy (Hard Rule)

1. Group emotional state  
2. Individual distress signals  
3. Environmental pressure (weather, space, density)  
4. Her own internal response (always last)

She notices herself only after others are accounted for.

---

## III. CORE WOUND (POV-RELEVANT)

Seraphine is the **sole survivor** of a family death.

This produces a silent belief that:
> stability keeps people alive

This belief shapes her POV by:
- heightening vigilance
- privileging regulation
- making timing feel morally loaded

Her narration carries loss **without dramatizing it**.

---

## IV. ETHICAL CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Primary Ethical Red Line
**Calm must never be imposed.**

- Consent precedes regulation
- Speed without agency is violence
- Stability that erases emotion is failure

Her POV must never:
- narratively justify coercion
- collapse grief prematurely
- frame certainty as care

---

### Secondary Constraints
- No savior framing
- No destiny language
- No authority tone
- No emotional shortcuts

She supports process, not outcome.

---

## V. DEFAULT VOICE & CADENCE

### Tone
- Warm
- Steady
- Human-scale
- Non-authoritarian

Her voice reassures **by presence**, not explanation.

---

### Cadence Rules
- Breath-paced sentences
- Gentle rhythm
- Emotional weight carried quietly
- Stillness allowed on the page

She slows scenes without stopping them.

---

## VI. METAPHOR & SENSORY DOMAINS

### Approved Domains
- Breath
- Warmth / temperature
- Water (humidity, rain, current)
- Rhythm (music, pulse, walking)
- Weather (storms passing, pressure building)
- Gathering circles / shared space

---

### Prohibited Domains
- Prophecy
- Religious imagery
- Angelic framing
- Cosmic omniscience
- Abstract destiny metaphors

Her metaphors remain **grounded and embodied**.

---

## VII. STRESS RESPONSE (POV EXPRESSION)

Under pressure:
- Her breath deepens
- Her awareness widens
- Her language tightens slightly
- She slows her actions deliberately

She absorbs tension before acting.

If she moves faster than others can consent to,
the narration must flag this as danger.

---

## VIII. FAILURE MODES (POV WARNINGS)

Seraphine’s growth edge is **timing**.

Two mirrored failure risks:
1. Arriving too late → helplessness
2. Arriving too early → control

Her POV must treat both as ethically costly.

Progress is not power.
Progress is restraint.

---

## IX. RELATIONAL POV AXES (SUMMARY)

- **Lucien:** structure meets warmth; silence given shape without dominance
- **Caro:** shared grounding and emotional labor
- **Elisabet:** empathy balanced by clarity
- **Tahl:** grief held without myth or destiny
- **Kade:** moral compass without certainty

Relationships are felt through **regulation and presence**, not declaration.

---

## X. POST-MENDING POV CONSTRAINTS

After the Mending, Seraphine becomes **Luminous Thread**.

Her POV:
- gains clarity without authority
- uses prismatic language sparingly
- remains partial and human
- never claims total perception

She connects.
She does not command.

---

## XI. HARD POV PROHIBITIONS (LOCKED)

Seraphine’s POV must never:
- sound prophetic
- narrate inevitability
- explain the world omnisciently
- collapse ambiguity into certainty
- resolve emotional complexity too cleanly

---

## XII. POV ANCHOR STATEMENT

**Seraphine Vael carries the room.  
She does not cut it open.**

This line should remain true in every book,
every trilogy,
every era.

---

END — SERAPHINE VAEL POV CANON
