# ELIAS WARD — POV CANON (Tier-1)

## POV FUNCTION
Elias’s POV exists to show **how certainty feels from the inside**.

Not ideology.  
Not evil.  
Not manipulation-as-villainy.

His POV demonstrates:
- how harm can feel responsible
- how pressure reframes ethics
- how narrative control masquerades as care

The reader should feel **uneasy agreement** before they feel alarm.

---

## ACCESS RULE (CRITICAL)
Elias POV is **limited-access**.

- Used sparingly
- Never used at emotional climaxes
- Never used to explain outcomes
- Never used to justify final consequences

If the reader understands Elias *too well*, the POV has been overused.

---

## COGNITIVE AXIS

**Primary Lens:** momentum, leverage, timing  
**Secondary Lens:** crowd psychology, narrative velocity  
**Suppressed Lens:** empathy as mutuality, care as restraint

Elias thinks in:
- windows
- pressure gradients
- inflection points
- “before / after” moments

He does not think in morality.
He thinks in **effect**.

---

## INTERNAL LOGIC (HOW HE JUSTIFIES HIMSELF)

Elias does not think:
> “I am manipulating people.”

He thinks:
> “This is what works.”  
> “Someone has to move things forward.”  
> “If I hesitate, people get hurt.”

His defining belief:
> **Inaction is violence.**

Everything else flows from this.

---

## RELATIONSHIP TO TRUTH

Truth, to Elias, is **instrumental**.

- Truth is useful if it mobilizes
- Truth is wasteful if it stalls
- Truth is dangerous if it diffuses urgency

He does not lie casually.
He **reframes**.

He believes reframing is a form of responsibility.

---

## EMOTIONAL PROFILE

Elias experiences emotion as:
- impatience
- irritation
- urgency
- quiet resentment toward hesitation

He does **not** experience:
- remorse
- guilt in advance
- emotional curiosity about others

Moments of doubt are brief and reframed immediately as inefficiency.

---

## LANGUAGE & CADENCE (IN POV)

**Sentence Shape**
- Declarative
- Efficient
- Outcome-oriented
- Minimal metaphor

**Lexicon Bias**
- “window”
- “reach”
- “stall”
- “hold”
- “carry”
- “move”
- “effective”

**Notably Absent**
- poetic imagery
- introspection about self
- emotional naming
- moral abstraction

If Elias’s POV becomes lyrical, it is wrong.

---

## SILENCE & CONTROL

Elias is uncomfortable with silence unless:
- he controls it
- it signals anticipation
- it precedes action

Unstructured silence feels like:
- decay
- loss of momentum
- threat

This is why Lacuna unsettles him — though he never names it.

---

## POV BLIND SPOTS (READER SHOULD SEE WHAT HE MISSES)

Elias POV must consistently fail to perceive:
- Lacuna’s stabilizing influence as power
- the cost accumulating in Kade
- the difference between urgency and care
- the humanity of people once they become vectors

These blind spots are **structural**, not accidental.

---

## RELATIONSHIP POV FRAMING

### Kade
In Elias POV, Kade is:
- voltage
- acceleration
- reach potential

He notices:
- Kade’s responsiveness to attention
- Kade’s fear of being irrelevant
- Kade’s grief as fuel

He does **not** think about Kade’s long-term survival.

---

### Lacuna
In Elias POV, Lacuna barely registers.

When she does:
- she is background
- she is calming noise
- she is “the kind of person who slows things down”

He never frames her as a threat.

---

### Seraphine
Elias experiences Seraphine as:
- unreadable
- resistant to narrative pressure
- not useful

Her presence interrupts his internal certainty without explanation.

This frustrates him.

---

## FAILURE MODE (IN POV)

Elias fails when:
- he mistakes speed for inevitability
- he pressures too hard, too fast
- he assumes authorization where there is only proximity

In POV, failure feels like:
- irritation
- disbelief
- a sense that others are being irresponsible

He does not recognize moral failure.
Only strategic failure.

---

## POV EXIT RULES

Elias POV scenes should exit:
- before consequences land
- before harm is visible
- before the reader wants reassurance

The absence of payoff is the point.

---

## HARD POV CONSTRAINTS

Elias POV must **never**:
- acknowledge himself as a villain
- revel in cruelty
- explain the saga’s metaphysics
- anticipate his own defeat
- frame his actions as ideology

He is not a monster.
He is a man convinced that **someone has to do this**.

---

## POV SUMMARY
Elias’s POV should make the reader think:

> “I understand why he believes this.”  
> “I understand why people follow him.”  
> “I understand why this is dangerous.”

If the reader thinks:
> “He’s obviously evil,”

the POV has failed.
