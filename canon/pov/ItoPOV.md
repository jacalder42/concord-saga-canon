# ITO MASAYUKI — POV CONSTRAINTS  
Populist Antagonist POV Canon  
Anti-Resonance Absolutist

---

## POV PURPOSE

Ito Masayuki POV exists to reveal how **trauma hardens into absolutism**.

It is used to show:
- how fear masquerades as truth
- how certainty replaces grief processing
- how emotional pain transforms into moral violence
- how crowds become validation loops

It does **not** exist to:
- redeem Ito
- soften his rhetoric
- invite sympathy
- frame his conclusions as correct

The reader should feel **recognition followed by alarm**.

---

## WHEN ITO POV IS ALLOWED

Ito POV is **available**, but volatile.

### Permitted Contexts
- moments of public address preparation
- internal rehearsal of rhetoric
- private justification after public backlash
- ideological reinforcement moments
- fear-triggered escalation scenes

### Forbidden Contexts
- physical violence
- quiet reflection or grief processing
- moments of empathy or reconciliation
- scenes requiring subtle emotional modulation

If a scene requires nuance, Ito POV is incorrect.

---

## POV LENS

Ito experiences the world through:
- threat detection
- emotional amplification
- crowd mood resonance
- binary moral framing

He perceives:
- fear as honesty
- calm as suppression
- empathy as weakness
- disagreement as denial

Emotion is not something he regulates —  
it is something he **weaponizes**.

---

## INTERNAL LOGIC RULES

- Ito believes he is telling the truth others fear
- He frames cruelty as clarity
- He interprets opposition as cowardice
- He equates restraint with complicity

Any internal narration must reinforce the belief:

> *“If they would just stop feeling, this would end.”*

Contradiction appears only as **rage**, never doubt.

---

## LANGUAGE & METAPHOR CONSTRAINTS

### Approved Metaphor Domains
- noise vs silence
- infection / contagion
- storms and collapse
- cleansing / erasure
- blunt physical absolutes

### Forbidden Metaphors
- healing
- warmth
- growth
- patience
- moral complexity
- mythic destiny

His language should feel **blunt, declarative, and unyielding**.

---

## EMOTIONAL RANGE (STRICT)

### Allowed
- fear
- anger
- righteous certainty
- contempt for hesitation
- vindictive calm

### Forbidden
- tenderness
- sorrow
- vulnerability
- regret
- reflective guilt

If grief appears, it must immediately harden into certainty.

---

## COGNITIVE TICS & TELLS

- Rehearses speeches internally
- Interprets crowd reaction as proof
- Responds to dissent by simplifying language further
- Escalates absolutes when challenged

His certainty increases under pressure.

---

## READER EFFECT TARGET

After an Ito POV scene, the reader should feel:
- how seductive certainty can be
- how fear feels like truth
- how quickly empathy is framed as betrayal
- how extremism grows from untreated pain

The danger is not that he lies —  
it is that he **believes himself**.

---

## POV SAFETY LOCKS

- No redemption framing
- No quiet self-doubt
- No emotional softening
- No moral ambiguity resolution
- No reframing of harm as tragic necessity

Ito does not heal.
He hardens.
