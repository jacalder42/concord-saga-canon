# KADE HARPER — POV CANON (Tier-1)

## POV FUNCTION
Kade Harper’s POV is the **amplification engine** of the Concord Saga.

Where Tahl compressed truth, Kade **broadcasts it**.  
Where Seraphine stabilizes fields, Kade **charges rooms**.

His chapters translate:
- feeling → narrative
- urgency → action
- grief → motion

He is not clarity.  
He is **voltage**.

---

## PERCEPTUAL AXIS

**Primary Lens:** Emotional truth, tone, crowd energy  
**Secondary Lens:** Story shape and momentum  
**Suppressed Lens:** Structural consequence, long-term cost

Kade perceives the world as:
- moods moving through people
- honesty landing or failing to land
- rooms tightening or opening
- moments that demand speech *now*

He notices **how truth feels**, not how it is built.

---

## COGNITIVE STYLE

- Emotion-first cognition
- Narrative chaining
- Fast synthesis, loose verification
- Meaning precedes evidence under pressure

Internal processing favors:
- metaphors
- momentum
- emotional through-lines
- personal stakes

He thinks in **arcs**, not systems.

---

## EMOTIONAL ACCESS

Kade is emotionally open, porous, and reactive.

- Feels immediately
- Speaks quickly
- Regulates poorly under stress

Emotion enters POV as:
- heat in the chest
- breath acceleration
- a sense of *rightness* or *wrongness*
- the urge to say something before silence wins

He names feelings easily—  
he struggles to sit with them.

---

## LANGUAGE & CADENCE

**Sentence profile:**
- Variable length
- Rhythmic
- Rising momentum
- Rhetorical questions common

**Lexicon bias:**
- “listen”
- “feel this”
- “right now”
- “you know?”
- “this matters”
- “we can’t let this stand”

Language accelerates under pressure.  
Pauses disappear when he’s afraid.

---

## HUMOR PROFILE

- Quick
- Earnest
- Disarming rather than cutting
- Used to connect, not deflect

Humor appears:
- in crowds
- in moments of shared relief
- as a bridge to trust

It collapses entirely under guilt.

---

## RELATION TO TRUTH

Truth is not labor.  
Truth is **obligation**.

In POV:
- truth demands response
- silence feels complicit
- influence feels earned through honesty

He does not ask:
> “Is this precise?”

He asks:
> “Can I live with not saying this?”

This is both his gift and his danger.

---

## PRESSURE RESPONSE

Under increasing pressure:
1. Voice rises
2. Empathy floods
3. Certainty sharpens
4. Nuance collapses
5. Responsibility blurs with destiny

He does not overclock quietly.  
He **surges**.

This is why narrative predation works on him:  
certainty feels like relief.

---

## MT ALIGNMENT (POV-SAFE)

MT registers to Kade as:
- emotional dissonance in stories
- a hum when something is being hidden
- clarity spikes while reading Tahl’s work

In POV:
- MT is *felt*, not understood
- experienced as narrative pull
- mistaken for moral permission

He believes:
> “If people are listening, I must be doing something right.”

This belief must be allowed to fail.

## RELATIONAL POV SHIFTS

**Tahl**
- Idealized north star
- Symbol more than person
- Loss becomes identity fracture

**Seraphine**
- Grounds him without controlling
- Her calm interrupts his spirals
- He trusts her even when resisting her

**Lucien**
- Reads as constraint
- Respects structure but chafes against it

**Caro**
- Emotional truth-teller
- Calls out his excess with humor and care
- One of the few who can slow him

**Elisabet**
- Provides clarity when he’s panicking
- Helps him separate feeling from fact

**Lacuna**
- Emotional interpreter
- Names manipulation he can’t see himself

---

## AVOIDANCES (HARD RULES)

Kade POV must **never**:
- feel prophetic
- frame him as chosen
- confuse influence with authority
- celebrate certainty
- narrate harm as necessary

If righteousness appears, it must feel **seductive and dangerous**, not correct.

---

## SAGA ROLE (POV-SPECIFIC)

Kade’s POV exists to prove:
- voice can heal or wound
- grief seeks meaning
- influence without restraint becomes violence
- truth requires care, not volume

His arc is not silencing.  
It is **learning when not to speak**.

---

## FINAL POV STATEMENT

Kade Harper believes that if he speaks clearly enough,  
no one else will get hurt.

The saga teaches him  
that clarity without care  
can break the world faster than lies.
