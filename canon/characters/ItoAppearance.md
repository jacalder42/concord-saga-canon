# ITO MASAYUKI — APPEARANCE CANON  
Tier-1 Antagonist Visual Reference  
Populist Demagogue • Choirless Catalyst

---

## PURPOSE

This file defines Ito Masayuki’s **visual and physical presentation** for consistency across prose, editorial reference, and potential art generation.

Ito’s appearance must communicate:
- civilian legitimacy
- emotional intensity without spectacle
- approachability turned volatile
- “one of us” authority rather than institutional power

He should never appear elite, ceremonial, or formally authoritarian.

---

## PHYSICAL PRESENCE

- Average build, unremarkable at first glance
- Tension held in shoulders and jaw
- Forward-leaning posture when speaking
- Body language charged, rarely still

Ito occupies space by **pressing into it**, not by commanding it.

---

## FACIAL & EXPRESSIVE RULES

- Highly expressive face
- Eyes quick to harden under challenge
- Jaw tightens during certainty
- Expressions swing rapidly from calm to intensity

Emotion is always visible —  
control is not.

---

## GESTURE & MOVEMENT

- Broad, emphatic gestures
- Hands often open or slicing through air
- Pacing during speeches
- Movement escalates with crowd response

His body language mirrors the emotional state of his audience.

---

## WARDROBE LOGIC

### VEIL / EARLY NEON
- Civilian clothing
- Muted streetwear or casual business attire
- Practical, non-elite fabrics
- Nothing that signals institutional authority

### LATE NEON
- Slightly sharper silhouettes
- Darker tones
- Still civilian, but more deliberate
- Clothing reinforces seriousness, not glamour

Ito must always look **accessible**, not elevated.

---

## VISUAL SIGNATURE

- Warm-to-neutral lighting bias
- High contrast between calm and intensity
- Slight visual chaos around him in crowds
- No clean geometry; edges feel unstable

Visually, Ito **amplifies disorder**.

---

## FORBIDDEN VISUAL CUES

- No formal uniforms
- No ceremonial symbols
- No metaphysical glow
- No elite tailoring
- No visual framing as mastermind

He must never look like he planned this.

---

## COMPARATIVE NOTES

Against Virelli:
- Ito is messier, louder, emotionally exposed

Against Han Wei:
- Ito appears human, volatile, uncontrolled

Against Choirless followers:
- Ito looks *slightly* more composed, but not separate
