# ELIAS WARD — RENDER CANON (Tier-1)

## RENDER FUNCTION
Elias Ward’s render profile ensures he appears **credible, unremarkable, and trustworthy** across all visual media.

He must never read as:
- a villain
- a cult leader
- a mythic antagonist
- visually dominant

If a viewer distrusts Elias on first sight, the render has failed.

## CANONICAL RENDER STATES

### 1. BASELINE — VEIL / EARLY NEON
**Usage:** Initial appearances, background coordination, early leverage

**Visual Read**
- Average build, forgettable silhouette
- Neutral posture with slight forward lean
- Clothing blends into environment

**Lighting**
- Naturalistic, practical light
- Soft overheads, window spill
- No dramatic contrast

**Mood**
- Competent
- Earnest
- Slightly strained

---

### 2. ENGAGED — NEON
**Usage:** Active persuasion, pressure escalation, early Brightbreak coordination

**Visual Read**
- Same silhouette
- Increased proximity to others
- Slight invasion of personal space

**VFX Constraints**
- None
- Absolutely no glow, aura, or symbolic lighting

**Lighting**
- Mixed warm/cool interiors
- Subtle directional light when speaking
- Shadows remain soft

**Hard Rule**
If Elias looks powerful instead of convincing, the render is wrong.

---

### 3. HIGH PRESSURE — LOOM
**Usage:** Kade manipulation window, late Brightbreak phase

**Visual Read**
- Tension visible in jaw and posture
- Warmth drains from expression
- Clothing slightly rumpled

**Lighting**
- Cooler palette
- Increased contrast
- Still realistic; never theatrical

**Mood**
- Urgent
- Impatient
- Necessary (in his own frame)

---

### 4. FAILURE — LOOM (LATE)
**Usage:** After leverage collapse, before Brightbreak dissolution

**Visual Read**
- Same physical body
- Micro-fractures only: tight jaw, shallow breath
- No overt breakdown

**Lighting**
- Flat, unflattering
- Institutional or ambient

**Mood**
- Disbelief
- Frustration
- Misread responsibility (“they didn’t act”)

---

### 5. POST-MENDING (RARE / OPTIONAL)
**Usage:** Epilogue glimpses only

**Visual Read**
- Reduced urgency
- Less layering
- Same man, diminished relevance

**Lighting**
- Neutral daylight
- No emphasis

**Mood**
- Residual certainty
- No reckoning

---

## CAMERA & FRAMING RULES

**Preferred Framing**
- Mid-shot
- Shoulder-level
- Off-center composition
- Often partially occluded by environment

**Avoid**
- Low-angle shots
- Center-frame dominance
- Symmetrical compositions
- Visual motifs implying power or destiny

Camera should treat Elias as **part of the system**, not above it.

## CANONICAL PROMPT PACK

### Portrait — Neutral
> middle-aged man, average build, light brown hair, neutral clothing, attentive expression, realistic lighting, documentary style, no symbolism

### Conversational — Persuasion
> man leaning slightly forward while speaking, open hands, neutral crisis-response clothing, indoor ambient light, believable realism, no dramatic shadows

### Loom — Pressure
> tense man in practical jacket, jaw set, cool interior lighting, slightly rumpled clothing, restrained realism

### Failure
> same man under flat lighting, tired expression, ordinary environment, no emphasis, human scale

---

## NEGATIVE PROMPTS (GLOBAL)

- no dramatic lighting
- no villain framing
- no cult aesthetics
- no glow or aura
- no symbolic color coding
- no theatrical poses

---

## CROSS-MEDIA CONSISTENCY RULE

Across all renders, Elias Ward must:
- appear plausible
- feel competent
- inspire initial trust
- never look exceptional

His threat emerges **over time**, not at first glance.
