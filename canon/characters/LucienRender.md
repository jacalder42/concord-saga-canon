# LUCIEN KAEL — RENDER PROFILE (Memory Edition)

**Purpose:** Visual generation reference for consistent portrayal of Lucien Kael  
**Derivation Sources:** Backstory Canon · POV Canon · EBCI Canon · Appearance Canon  
**Constraints:** No invention, no mythic excess, no supernatural framing  
**Visual Thesis:** Architecture embodied — restraint, clarity, silence held as care

---

## I. CORE VISUAL IDENTITY

Lucien Kael presents as a tall, lean, structured man whose presence reads as deliberate and contained.

Key impressions:
- architectural stillness  
- quiet authority without dominance  
- restraint that suggests pressure, not emptiness  
- warmth implied beneath precision  

He should never appear flamboyant, relaxed, or casually expressive.

## II. PHYSICAL PROFILE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Height: tall (6'1"–6'3" range)  
- Build: lean-structured, long frame, restrained muscle  
- Posture: upright, aligned, minimal movement  
- Face: sharp, symmetrical features; angular jaw; high cheekbones  
- Eyes: gray-blue / steel-toned; observant, reflective  
- Hair: dark, neat; precision-cut in Veil, slightly disordered under stress  

Skin tone: pale to fair (Central European)

## III. EXPRESSION & MICRO-ACTING

Default expression:
- neutral, assessing  
- emotion visible only in micro-tells  

Emotional indicators:
- slight tightening around eyes  
- subtle jaw tension or release  
- gaze lingering longer than intended  

**Forbidden expressions:**
- exaggerated smiles  
- cartoonish sadness  
- overt anger displays  
- seductive or dominant affect  

---

## IV. POSTURE & MOVEMENT RULES

Movement vocabulary:
- economical, efficient  
- straight-line motion  
- no wasted gestures  

Common tells:
- jaw click  
- controlled nasal exhale  
- fingers aligning along seams or edges  

Stillness must feel *intentional*, not passive.

## V. WARDROBE & MATERIAL LANGUAGE

### Veil Era
- tailored black, charcoal, deep gray  
- structured coats, high collars  
- clean lines, formal silhouettes  

### Neon Era
- darker, functional layers  
- subtle disorder or wear  
- frayed edges under strain  

### Loom Era
- minimalist, weather-rated materials  
- deep blues and grays  
- structure softened, not lost  

### Post-Mending
- softened fabrics  
- retained geometry  
- muted blues, white accents  

Materials:
- wool, structured cotton, soft knits  
- dark leather accents  

**Forbidden:** bright colors, loose silhouettes, fantasy or ceremonial robes

---

## VI. RESONANCE & VFX GUIDELINES

Baseline:
- pale-blue or silver line-light  
- clean silhouette outlines  

Strain:
- white/gray flicker  
- subtle geometric vibration  

Bloom (rare):
- soft blue-white concentric rings  

Overload:
- fracture geometry  
- hard angles  
- sharp flicker patterns  

Lucien’s VFX should always favor **geometry over glow**.

---

## VII. ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT

Best visual settings:
- architectural interiors  
- quiet urban spaces  
- corridors, thresholds, stairwells  
- environments with visible structure (stone, glass, metal)  

Lighting:
- controlled, directional  
- cool-toned  
- rim light preferred over frontal glow  

Avoid chaotic or visually noisy backgrounds unless depicting Neon overload.

---

## VIII. RELATIONAL VISUAL MODULATION

With Seraphine:
- posture softens subtly  
- shoulders lower  
- gaze warms  
- silence appears breathable  

With antagonists:
- posture tightens  
- geometry sharpens  
- light becomes colder  

With crowds:
- Lucien stabilizes space visually without commanding it

## IX. GENERATIVE PROMPT — BASE (PORTRAIT)

“tall lean man with structured posture, sharp angular features, gray-blue eyes, dark neat hair, wearing tailored black or charcoal clothing, architectural presence, restrained expression, subtle pale-blue line-light along silhouette, cinematic minimalism, controlled rim lighting, European aesthetic, high-end portrait photography”

---

## X. GENERATIVE PROMPT — DYNAMIC / SCENE

“precise controlled movement, lean structured silhouette, geometric resonance distortion, blue-white flicker VFX, fitted dark layers, emotionally restrained presence, cinematic lighting, architectural environment, minimal motion blur”

---

## XI. NEGATIVE PROMPTS (GLOBAL)

“no anime, no fantasy armor, no glowing runes, no magical symbols, no prophecy imagery, no superhero styling, no neon cyberpunk, no flamboyant fashion, no exaggerated expressions”

---

## XII. CINEMATIC PARAMETERS
