# TRIP — IDENTITY CANON (Tier-1)

## I. Core Identity
- **Name:** Trip (professional name; legal name intentionally undisclosed)
- **Role Function:** social stabilizer; threshold keeper; continuity witness
- **Saga Position:** human-scale connective tissue across trilogies; maintains social coherence as institutions and metaphysical structures fracture
- **Hard Rule:** Trip’s authority is social and situational; she never claims truth, leadership, or narrative control

## II. Geographic Origin
- **Birthplace:** New Orleans, Louisiana
- **Neighborhood Ecology:** Tremé → Marigny / French Quarter adjacency
- **Emotional Home:** nightlife and hospitality spaces where private truth surfaces in public-adjacent rooms

## III. Cultural Origin / Heritage
- **Heritage:** Black American (New Orleans Creole–adjacent civic culture)
- **Cultural imprint (compressed):** rhythm-based perception; verbal agility; emotional intelligence expressed through timing and tone
- **Identity impact:** early mastery of reading rooms; safety created through presence, humor, and pacing rather than authority

## IV. Family Structure & Emotional Ecology
- **Mother:** **Thalia “Tally” Baptiste** — primary caregiver; grounded civic realism; emotional literacy modeled through steadiness
- **Auntie / Drag Parent:** **Bernadette “Birdie” James** — chosen-family authority; performance lineage; boundary-setting through presence and command of space
- **Father:** unknown, unnamed, irrelevant; absence normalized and non-traumatic
- **Household dynamic (compressed):** matriarchal and chosen-family centered; care expressed through watchfulness, humor, and keeping people safe in public spaces
- **Foundational imprint:** if the room is not managed, people get hurt — and no one else will step in

## V. Socioeconomic Position
- **Class position:** working-class service economy
- **Economic profile:** income volatility balanced by strong social networks
- **Institutional proximity:** low; institutions are customers, not protectors
- **Primary cost:** emotional labor rendered invisible as hospitality

## VI. Occupation / Pre-Saga Trajectory
- **Primary Occupation:** bartender / host at the Velvet Vein
- **Professional identity:** curator of atmosphere; conflict diffuser; threshold gatekeeper
- **Skill identity (compressed):** conversational redirection; tension deflection; selective disclosure; controlled access
- **Pre-Saga Trajectory:** nightlife work chosen deliberately as a position of information flow and safety, not as fallback or escape

## VII. Formative Imprints (Identity-Relevant)
- **Early exposure to adult social spaces:** accelerated emotional literacy and boundary awareness
- **Observed boundary violations:** humor and calm learned as shields
- **Repeated role as listener rather than speaker:** narrative control through restraint
- **Learning when not to intervene:** timing becomes power equal to action

## VIII. Psychological Architecture (Identity Loop)
- **Core wound:** chaos escalates when people feel unseen
- **Core belief:** safety is created socially before it is enforced structurally
- **Stress behaviors:** hyper-vigilance; wit sharpened into armor; emotional fatigue masked as charm
- **Failure mode (LOCKED):** choosing to smooth when confrontation is needed; protecting atmosphere at the cost of truth
- **Regulation style:** humor, pacing, selective intimacy, pause

## IX. Authority & POV Constraints (LOCKED)
- **Leadership ceiling:** Trip does not lead movements, factions, or strategy
- **Authority posture:** host, witness, stabilizer, mirror
- **POV rule:** Trip may name tension but never diagnose cause; she observes patterns, not truths
- **Explicit rule:** Trip influences through conversation and presence, never through instruction or explanation

## X. Temporal & Bridge Function (LOCKED)
- **Temporal rule:** Trip experiences time linearly and ages normally
- **Continuity function:** appears across trilogies because people continue to gather in her spaces
- **Bridge framing:** all bridges, supplements, and expansions associated with Trip are presented as **conversations overheard at the bar**
- **Reader relationship:** the reader is another presence in the room; Trip never addresses the reader directly

## XI. Trilogy Anchor Facts (Identity-Relevant)
- **Veil:** neutral ground; fragile truths surface sideways
- **Neon:** continuity anchor as institutions fracture; social glue persists
- **Loom:** one of the few stable human presences; guides without steering
- **Post-Mending:** continues as host and connector; frames stories without authorship or control

## XII. Canon Conflict Ledger (Preserved Record)
- **Name ambiguity:** Trip’s legal name intentionally undisclosed across canon; treated as identity choice, not omission
- **Family naming variance:** Tally Baptiste (mother) and Birdie James (auntie/drag parent) now locked; earlier ambiguities superseded
- **Role phrasing variance:** bartender / host / nightlife anchor used interchangeably; non-conflicting

END — TRIP IDENTITY CANON
