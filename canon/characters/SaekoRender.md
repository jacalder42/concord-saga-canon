# SAEKO MORITA — RENDER GUIDE  
Tier-1 Ideological Antagonist Illustration Reference  
Serenity Coercion • Quiet Absolutism

---

## RENDER INTENT

Render Saeko Morita as a figure of **gentle authority and imposed calm**.

She should read as:
- serene
- composed
- reassuring at first glance
- subtly unsettling on reflection

The danger is not threat —  
it is **comfort without consent**.

---

## COMPOSITION RULES

- Balanced, centered composition
- Still, grounded posture
- No dynamic motion or implied action
- Frame should feel quiet and contained

The image should feel as if sound has been turned down.

---

## LIGHTING

- Soft, diffuse lighting
- Low contrast
- Even illumination
- No dramatic highlights or shadows

Light should feel **soothing but flattening**.

---

## COLOR PALETTE

- Pale neutrals
- Soft grays
- Low-saturation blues and greens
- Occasional warm off-white

Avoid:
- strong contrast
- vivid color
- harsh blacks or reds

Color should recede rather than draw attention.

---

## FACIAL EXPRESSION

- Neutral, serene expression
- Gentle eyes without visible warmth
- Mouth relaxed, unreadable
- No visible tension or intensity

She should look **peaceful**, not kind.

---

## MATERIAL & TEXTURE

- Soft, matte fabrics
- Minimal texture variation
- Clean surfaces
- No visual noise or distress

Everything should feel **calming and impersonal**.

---

## STYLE CONSTRAINTS

- No heroic framing
- No villain exaggeration
- No cinematic menace
- No resonance or metaphysical effects
- No symbolic props or iconography

This is authority through **quiet presence**, not power display.

---
