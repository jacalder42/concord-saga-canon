# MARCELLUS VIRELLI — APPEARANCE CANON  
Tier-1 Antagonist Visual Reference

---

## PURPOSE

This file defines Marcellus Virelli’s **visual and physical presentation** for consistency across prose, editorial reference, and potential art generation.

Virelli’s appearance must reinforce:
- authority through restraint
- control without aggression
- compassion framed as discipline

He should never appear visually theatrical or emotionally expressive.

---

## PHYSICAL PRESENCE

- Tall, upright posture
- Aristocratic bearing
- Controlled, economical movement
- Stillness that reads as confidence, not passivity

He occupies space without expanding into it.

---

## FACIAL & EXPRESSIVE RULES

- Severe, precise grooming
- Neutral or mildly corrective expression
- Still eyes with suppressed affect
- No visible emotional tells under pressure

Emotion is present only as judgment.

---

## GESTURE & MOVEMENT

- Minimal hand movement
- Straight-line gestures
- No pacing or agitation
- Movements are deliberate and efficient

He never fidgets.  
He never rushes.

---

## WARDROBE LOGIC

### VEIL / NEON ERAS
- Dominion blacks, charcoals, muted silvers
- Immaculate tailoring
- Clean, uninterrupted lines
- No ornamentation or symbolic flair

### LOOM ERA (LEGACY APPEARANCES)
- Slightly softened materials
- Same restrained palette
- Authority persists even as institutions fracture

His clothing is a uniform of certainty.

---

## VISUAL SIGNATURE

- Straight-line geometry
- Anti-bloom aesthetic
- Subtle light suppression
- No resonance glow or distortion
- No expressive color shifts

Visually, Virelli **negates chaos**.

---

## FORBIDDEN VISUAL CUES

- No scars or battle damage
- No disarray or loosened clothing
- No visible fatigue
- No flamboyance or symbolic costuming
- No visual indicators of inner conflict

He must never look “haunted” or “tortured.”

---

## COMPARATIVE NOTES

Against emotionally expressive characters, Virelli should read as:
- colder
- cleaner
- more controlled

His menace is **conceptual**, not physical.
