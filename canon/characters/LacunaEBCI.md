# LACUNA — EBCI CANON (Tier-1)

## EBCI ROLE FUNCTION
Lacuna functions as the Concord Saga’s **human-scale stabilizer and emotional interpreter**.

She does not command, lead, or resolve.
She **modulates**:
- emotional amplitude
- crowd volatility
- interpersonal escalation
- resonance pressure spillover

Her EBCI profile governs:
- where collapse slows
- how chaos is redistributed instead of amplified
- why certain spaces remain survivable during Loom

She is not authority.
She is **containment without coercion**.

## CORE MODE PROFILE

**Primary Modes**
- CIV — Civic / communal presence
- INT — Interior processing (listening, restraint)

**Secondary Modes**
- HUM — Sharp grounding humor (situational)
- ACT — Only when movement supports stabilization

**Forbidden as Primary**
- SCI — Systems analysis
- ROM — Never driver (potential only, deferred)
- FUN — Never driver
- HOR — Never driver

Lacuna reduces volatility by **not escalating modes**.

---

## CORRIDOR COMPATIBILITY

**Baseline Comfort**
- U1 — Safe (most effective)
- U2 — Static (harmonic regulation)
- U3 — Pressure (active stabilizer)

**Destabilization Threshold**
- U4 — Emotional saturation
- U5 — Risk of overwhelm without support
- U6 — Unsurvivable for prolonged duration

**Hard Rule**
Lacuna must not operate alone in U5+ corridors.  
Presence of Seraphine, Caro, or Elisabet is required to prevent collapse or disappearance.

---

## RESONANCE INTERACTION (NON-MYSTICAL)

**MT (Mortal Thread)**
- Interacts indirectly through:
  - tone modulation
  - pacing
  - crowd harmonics
- She translates MT impact emotionally, not informationally.

**VT (VeilThread)**
- No intentional access
- Reactivity manifests as:
  - tightening spiral gestures
  - deepening indigo haze
  - auditory hum distortion
- She does not interpret VT meaning by default.

**LT**
- Not accessible
- Post-Mending clarity hum only; no agency

**Hard Separation Rule**
MT ≠ VT ≠ LT at all times.

---

## PRESSURE BEHAVIOR

Pressure accumulates around Lacuna via:
- proximity to emotional collapse
- prolonged crowd exposure
- repeated acts of restraint
- staying present instead of disappearing

Observable effects:
- ambient noise dampens near her
- crowd pacing slows
- interpersonal escalation de-escalates
- small pockets of calm persist

Her cost is internal, not visible.

## TRILOGY-SPECIFIC EBCI BEHAVIOR

### VEIL
- Peripheral presence
- Early detector of emotional misalignment
- No naming, only sensing
- Quiet influence at margins

### NEON
- Informal stabilizer
- Helps prevent total collapse in localized pockets
- Acts as emotional counter-amplifier to Kade
- Begins to accumulate personal cost

### LOOM
- One of the last consistent grounding forces
- Operates under sustained pressure
- Resists Brightbreak narrative escalation
- Maintains human-scale truth amid collapse

---

## RELATIONAL FIELD EFFECTS

**With Seraphine**
- Breath-to-hum synergy
- Amplifies Seraphine’s stabilization field
- Mutual restraint ethic

**With Lucien**
- Curves vs lines dynamic
- Softens severity without undermining structure

**With Caro**
- Spark + spiral synergy
- Rapid tension diffusion

**With Elisabet**
- Quiet clarity alignment
- Helps Elisabet hold emotional weight without overload

**With Rex**
- Mutual trust around fragile systems
- Precision + rhythm stabilizes tech-adjacent spaces

**With Tahl**
- Early warning presence
- Emotional buffering without intervention

**With Kade (UPDATED)**
- Acts as emotional limiter, not director
- Reduces narrative runaway risk
- Presence introduces hesitation without command
- Romantic potential increases emotional charge but does not resolve it

---

## FAILURE CONDITIONS (CANONICAL)

Lacuna fails when:
- restraint becomes disappearance
- silence replaces care
- cost exceeds capacity without relief
- she absorbs pressure without redistribution

Failure expresses as:
- withdrawal
- vanishing from scenes
- emotional numbness
- loss of rhythm

---

## RARE INTERPRETATION EVENT (TRILOGY-CAPPED)

**Permission**
- At most **once per trilogy**

**Trigger**
- Extreme pressure
- No other interpretive carrier available

**Effect**
- Brief interpretive clarity beyond emotional read

**Cost**
- Disorientation
- Loss of safety
- Post-event retreat
- Lasting consequence

This is not power.
It is **damage paid for information**.

---

## EBCI HARD CONSTRAINTS

- Lacuna cannot lead factions
- Cannot stabilize shards directly
- Cannot resolve crises alone
- Cannot replace Seraphine’s field authority
- Cannot become narrative authority
- Power always relational, never coercive

---

## FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY

Lacuna exists in EBCI terms as:
- the proof that listening changes outcomes
- the counterweight to amplification
- the keeper of human-scale continuity

She does not stop collapse.
She makes survival **possible inside it**.
