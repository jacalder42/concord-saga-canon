# TAHL MORGAN — RENDER CANON (Tier-1)

## RENDER FUNCTION
Tahl Morgan’s render profile exists to ensure **visual consistency across illustration, concept art, covers, motion tests, and promotional material**.

He must always read as:
- human
- pressured
- cognitively intense
- non-mythic

Any render that elevates him toward iconography is incorrect.

**Lighting**
- Naturalistic
- Interior fluorescents
- Overcast daylight
- Practical city light only

**Mood**

---

### 2. MORTAL — PRESSURE / VT PROXIMITY
**Usage:** Late Neon only

**Visual Read**
- Same physical body
- Perceptual strain visible
- No transformation

**VFX Constraints**
- Subtle violet planar flicker at:
  - eye edges
  - throat line
  - background planes
- Minor spatial distortion
- No aura
- No full-body glow

**Lighting**
- Contrast increases
- Background instability only
- Subject remains grounded

**Hard Rule**
If the effect looks “cool,” it is wrong.

### 3. ECHO — POST-DEATH
**Usage:** Loom only (restricted appearances)

**Visual Read**
- Memory-silhouette of Tahl
- Softened edges
- Reduced physical weight
- No literal transparency horror

**Color Palette**
- Gold–rose shimmer
- Lantern-like warmth
- Low saturation

**Motion**
- Smooth
- Gentle
- Slightly slowed
- Emotion-driven, not physics-driven

**Forbidden**
- Angelic imagery
- Wings
- Floating robes
- Neon glow
- Ghost tropes

Echo Tahl is **presence**, not spectacle.

## CAMERA & FRAMING RULES

**Preferred Framing**
- Mid-shot
- Close-medium
- Slightly off-center
- Cropped environments

**Avoid**
- Hero low angles
- Symmetry-heavy compositions
- Centered “chosen” framing

Camera should feel:
- observational
- documentary-adjacent
- human-scale

## CANONICAL PROMPT PACK

### Portrait — Mortal
> lean investigative man, medium-length messy dark curls, sharp thoughtful eyes rimmed with exhaustion, subtle forward lean, layered hoodie and jacket, muted neutral colors, naturalistic lighting, grounded realism, no glow, no stylization

### Dynamic — Investigation
> investigative journalist under pressure, tense posture, notebook or recorder in hand, urban interior lighting, slight motion blur, documentary framing, no heroic angles

### VT Proximity
> same investigative figure under perceptual strain, faint violet planar flicker near eyes and background, spatial distortion only, restrained cinematic lighting, no aura, no fantasy effects

### Echo Form
> soft gold-rose echo of a man, gentle lantern glow, simplified silhouette of curls and jacket, warm prismatic light, calm presence, non-ghostly, no wings, no transparency horror

## NEGATIVE PROMPTS (GLOBAL)

- no angel wings  
- no glowing armor  
- no magical fire  
- no superhero framing  
- no neon aura  
- no anime proportions  
- no fantasy robes  
- no horror ghost transparency  

---

## CROSS-MEDIA CONSISTENCY RULE

Across **all renders**, Tahl Morgan must:
- look tired before he looks powerful
- look human before he looks symbolic
- look pressured before he looks important

If a render inspires awe instead of concern, it has failed.
