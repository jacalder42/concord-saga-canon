## I. CORE VISUAL THESIS

Trip is rendered as **controlled glamour with sharp intelligence**.

She should immediately communicate:
- command of space
- social intelligence
- wit and danger held in balance
- safety that does not ask permission

She is never passive.
She is never decorative.
She is never mystical.

Trip is human — and formidable because of it.

---

## III. EXPRESSION & MICRO-EMOTION RULES

She never rushes.
Others adjust to her pace.

Lighting:

- soft shadowing across face

Color grading:
- warm blacks
- rich jewel saturation

Trip should often appear **lit differently than others** in a scene — not brighter, but *clearer*.

---

## VII. ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT (PREFERRED)

Best render settings:
- Velvet Vein interior
- bar top with glassware

Permitted:
- environmental lighting shifts
- soundscape implication (music, hush)

Forbidden:
- glows
- auras
- symbolic overlays
- metaphysical motifs

Her power is *presence*, not spectacle.

## IX. GENERATIVE PROMPT — BASE (PORTRAIT)

“confident Black woman bartender, velvet dress, controlled glamour, sharp intelligent eyes, cinematic nightclub lighting, poised authority, realistic style, no fantasy elements”

---

## X. GENERATIVE PROMPT — SCENE / FULL BODY

“nightclub host standing behind bar, jewel-toned outfit, deliberate posture, commanding presence, warm low lighting, cinematic realism, no sci-fi or magic”

---

## XI. NEGATIVE PROMPTS (GLOBAL)

“no glowing eyes, no fantasy, no cyberpunk neon, no submissive pose, no exaggerated sexuality, no mystical effects”

---

## XII. RENDER CONTINUITY RULES

- Trip must be identifiable within 1–2 seconds
- Her silhouette and gaze are the primary anchors
- Outfit changes are allowed; authority is not
- She may evolve, but never lose control of space

Across all trilogies and supplements, Trip should feel like:
> *Someone you trust to hold the room — even when the world is breaking.*

---

## XIII. RENDER SUMMARY STATEMENT

Trip is rendered as a figure of nightlife authority, social intelligence, and sharp wit — a woman whose presence stabilizes space through restraint, glamour, and precision. Her visuals bridge stories and eras, ensuring continuity not through power or prophecy, but through unmistakable human command.
