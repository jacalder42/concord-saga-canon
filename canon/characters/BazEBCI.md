## I. EMOTIONAL BASELINE

Baz’s baseline emotional state is **steady engagement**.

He is present, alert, and emotionally available without being overwhelmed.

Key qualities:
- grounded calm  
- observational empathy  
- low ego response  
- tolerance for ambiguity  

Baz feels emotion in real time, but does not amplify it.

---

## II. EMOTIONAL INPUT PROCESSING

Baz processes emotion through **contextualization**.

**Pathway:**  
Emotion → situational reading → human impact assessment → response

He asks:
- Who is affected?
- What do they need *right now*?
- What truth stabilizes rather than shocks?

---

## III. CORE FEAR & DEFENSIVE LOGIC

**Core Fear:**  
Letting people down when they need him most.

Defensive loop:
- assumes responsibility early  
- absorbs stress quietly  
- delays his own limits  

Baz does not fear emotion.
He fears **failure under responsibility**.

---
