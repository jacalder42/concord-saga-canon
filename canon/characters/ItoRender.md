# ITO MASAYUKI — RENDER GUIDE  
Tier-1 Populist Antagonist Illustration Reference

---

## RENDER INTENT

Render Ito Masayuki as a **civilian figure charged with volatile certainty**.

He should read as:
- recognizably ordinary
- emotionally intense
- rhetorically dangerous
- amplified by crowds rather than elevated above them

The threat is **contagious emotion**, not authority.

---

## COMPOSITION RULES

- Asymmetrical or slightly unstable framing
- Mid-shot or close framing preferred
- Body angled forward, engaging the viewer
- Crowd presence implied or partial, not dominant

The image should feel **pressurized**, not composed.

---

## LIGHTING

- Warm-to-neutral lighting
- Uneven illumination acceptable
- Faces partially shadowed during intensity
- Avoid clean, studio-like light

Light should feel **situational**, not controlled.

---

## COLOR PALETTE

- Earth tones
- Muted reds and oranges
- Neutral grays and browns

Avoid:
- pristine whites
- elite blacks
- cold institutional blues

Color should feel **human and unstable**.

---

## FACIAL EXPRESSION

- Intense focus
- Jaw set, eyes sharp
- Expression caught mid-declaration
- No calm neutrality

He should appear as if **mid-sentence**.

---

## MATERIAL & TEXTURE

- Everyday fabrics
- Slight wear or rumpling acceptable
- No pristine tailoring
- No symbolic accessories

Nothing should look rehearsed or ceremonial.

---

## STYLE CONSTRAINTS

- No heroic framing
- No villain exaggeration
- No metaphysical effects
- No symbolic lighting
- No propaganda-poster composition

This is a man *inside* the moment, not above it.

---

## OPTIONAL PROMPT SEED (MJ / SDXL)

Use as a baseline; adjust as needed.

> “ordinary Japanese man speaking intensely to a crowd, civilian clothing, expressive face, forward-leaning posture, warm uneven lighting, emotional volatility, documentary realism, asymmetrical framing, no uniforms, no symbols”

---

## FORBIDDEN RENDER CHOICES

- No elevated podium dominance
- No militaristic imagery
- No elite backdrops
- No stylized iconography
- No mythic framing

Ito must look **possible**.
