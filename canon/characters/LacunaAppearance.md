# LACUNA — APPEARANCE CANON (Tier-1)

## APPEARANCE FUNCTION
Lacuna’s appearance communicates **fluid human grounding under pressure**.

She should never read as:
- mystical
- ornamental
- authoritative
- performative for its own sake

Her visual presence signals:
- attentiveness
- adaptability
- emotional literacy
- survival-honed grace

If she looks like a “witch,” “seer,” or “ritual leader,” the design has failed.

Lacuna looks like someone who:

She is not the center of the room.  
She is the reason the room doesn’t break.
