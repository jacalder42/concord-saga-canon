# MARCELLUS VIRELLI — RENDER GUIDE  
Tier-1 Antagonist Illustration Reference

---

## RENDER INTENT

Render Marcellus Virelli as an **institutional authority figure** whose presence communicates inevitability rather than threat.

He should read as:
- calm
- composed
- morally certain
- quietly immovable

The danger is intellectual and systemic, not physical.

---

## COMPOSITION RULES

- Centered or near-centered framing
- Symmetrical or near-symmetrical composition
- Upright posture, shoulders squared
- No dynamic angles or motion blur

The image should feel *stable* and *controlled*.

---

## LIGHTING

- Cool, neutral lighting
- Even illumination with minimal contrast
- No dramatic shadowing
- No haloing or bloom effects

Light should clarify, not dramatize.

---

## COLOR PALETTE

- Black
- Charcoal
- Cold silver
- Muted off-white

Avoid:
- warm tones
- saturated color
- emotional color contrast

---

## FACIAL EXPRESSION

- Neutral or faintly corrective
- Eyes steady, appraising
- No smile, no scowl
- No visible emotional strain

He is not performing for the viewer.

---

## MATERIAL & TEXTURE

- High-quality, matte fabrics
- Clean surfaces
- Minimal texture noise
- No weathering or distress

Nothing about him should look improvised.

---

## STYLE CONSTRAINTS

- No heroic framing
- No villain exaggeration
- No cinematic menace
- No resonance or metaphysical effects
- No symbolic props

This is **authority without spectacle**.

---

## OPTIONAL PROMPT SEED (MJ / SDXL)

Use only as a starting point; adjust as needed.

> “aristocratic European statesman, severe elegance, controlled posture, minimalist black tailored suit, neutral expression, cool even lighting, institutional authority, restrained power, non-dramatic realism, symmetrical composition”

---

## FORBIDDEN RENDER CHOICES

- No action poses
- No emotional distortion
- No visual metaphors (chains, shadows, fire, light)
- No damaged environments
- No dramatic background storytelling

The image must feel bureaucratically clean.
