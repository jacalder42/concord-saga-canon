## I. CORE VISUAL IDENTITY

Baz Arnaud presents as a grounded, approachable man whose presence feels steady and trustworthy.

Key impressions:
- human-scale competence

## VI. RESONANCE & VFX RULES

Baz has **no native VFX**.

- No glow  
- No bloom  
- No emitted geometry  

Under resonance pressure:
- environmental distortion may appear *around* him  
- tension shows physically (breath, posture)  

Baz’s value is remaining visually human in extraordinary conditions.

---

## VII. ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT

Best visual settings:
- streets, docks, community spaces  
- interiors with lived-in wear  
- civic buildings, kitchens, workspaces  

Lighting:
- warm-natural daylight  
- streetlight amber  
- practical indoor lighting  

Avoid dramatic backlighting or stylized glow.

## VIII. RELATIONAL VISUAL MODULATION

With Lucien:
- Baz occupies human space  
- Lucien occupies structural edges  
- Baz’s warmth offsets Lucien’s geometry  

With Seraphine:
- shared warmth  
- grounded presence stabilizes bloom  

With crowds:
- Baz becomes visual anchor  
- people naturally orient toward him
