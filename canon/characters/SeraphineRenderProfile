## IDENTITY TOKENS (STABLE)

- Black Creole–Cajun woman
- adult, mid-30s appearance (adjustable by scene)
- warm medium-brown skin with subtle golden undertones
- expressive warm brown eyes
- natural curl texture
- soft-athletic, grounded physicality
- calm, empathetic presence
- human-scale realism (not stylized)

---

## BODY PROPORTION RATIOS (PRIMARY SHAPE CONTROL)

Use **realistic human proportions defined by relative ratios**, not stylized extremes.

### HEIGHT & SCALE
- Overall scale: average adult woman
- Visual grounding: human-scale, not elongated

---

### SHOULDER : HIP RATIO
- Shoulders : hips ≈ **0.9 : 1.0**
- Hips slightly wider than shoulders
- Shoulder line soft and rounded, not squared

Creates a grounded, welcoming lower-body anchor.

---

### WAIST RELATIONSHIP
- Waist softly defined, not cinched
- Waist : hip ≈ **0.8 : 1.0**
- Natural curve without sculpted taper

Avoid dramatic hourglass shaping.

---

### TORSO : LEG BALANCE
- Torso : leg length ≈ **1.0 : 1.0**
- Legs strong and present, not elongated
- Visual strength comes from stability, not length

Avoid runway-model proportions.

---

### CHEST / UPPER TORSO MASS
- Upper torso mass balanced with hips
- Chest reads as natural fullness, not projection
- No cleavage emphasis
- Chest is part of torso mass, not a focal point

---

### ARM & LEG VOLUME
- Arms: soft-toned, functional volume
- Legs: strong thighs and calves
- Muscle reads as **used**, not trained

Avoid fitness-model definition.

---

### OVERALL SILHOUETTE READ
The body should read as:
- bottom-weighted
- stable
- warm
- human
- comforting

Visual center of gravity sits slightly below the waist.

---

## POSTURE & PRESENCE (CRITICAL)

Posture must always communicate:
- open chest
- relaxed shoulders
- grounded stance
- gentle readiness

Her body language should convey:
“I’m here. You’re safe. We’ll handle it.”

Posture matters more than exact measurements.

---

## FACE & EXPRESSION

- soft-edged cheekbones
- rounded brows
- gently tapered jawline
- relaxed mouth with a subtle micro-smile
- emotional intelligence visible even at rest

Expression should read as:
calm • attentive • empathetic • steady

Avoid glam, editorial, or aloof expressions.

---

## HAIR TOKENS

- natural curls, **3B–3C texture**
- dark brown with sun-softened highlights
- shoulder to upper-back length
- humidity-reactive curls (soft lift, loose edges)

Styles:
- loose curls
- half-up
- simple ties or protective styles under stress

Avoid straightened hair, wigs, fantasy braids, or high-glam styling.

---

## WARDROBE TOKENS (DEFAULT)

### Materials
- breathable cotton
- linen
- soft denim
- light knits
- lived-in textures

### Silhouettes

### Colors
- rust
- cream
- moss
- bayou green
- warm browns
- muted earth tones

### Details

Avoid high fashion, stiff tailoring, military silhouettes, or sci-fi materials.

---
