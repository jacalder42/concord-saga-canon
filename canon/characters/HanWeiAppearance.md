# DIRECTOR HAN WEI — APPEARANCE CANON  
Tier-1 Antagonist Visual Reference  
Technarc Architect • Rationalist Extremist

---

## PURPOSE

This file defines Han Wei’s **visual and physical presentation** for consistency across prose, editorial reference, and potential art generation.

Han Wei’s appearance must communicate:
- precision over warmth
- control over presence
- intelligence without charisma
- safety framed as sterility

He should never appear theatrical, emotive, or visually dominant.

---

## PHYSICAL PRESENCE

- Compact, efficient posture
- Minimal wasted motion
- Upright but not expansive stance
- Movements measured and economical

He occupies space **functionally**, not socially.

---

## FACIAL & EXPRESSIVE RULES

- Neutral, analytical expression
- Eyes that track rather than engage
- Suppressed affect; no visible emotional tells
- Rare blinking under stress, gaze steady

Emotion registers only as calculation.

---

## GESTURE & MOVEMENT

- Precise, angular gestures
- Hands used sparingly, often to indicate structure or sequence
- Frequent ninety-degree turns rather than curves
- No fidgeting, pacing, or expressive emphasis

His body language suggests **systems logic**, not persuasion.

---

## WARDROBE LOGIC

### VEIL / NEON ERAS
- Technarc neutrals: grays, off-whites, muted blues
- Clean, modular tailoring
- Functional fabrics with minimal texture
- No ornamentation, insignia, or personal flair

### LOOM ERA (LEGACY APPEARANCES)
- Same palette, slightly more rigid materials
- Clothing reads as outdated but still precise
- Authority persists despite systemic failure

His clothing prioritizes **clarity and repeatability**.

---

## VISUAL SIGNATURE

- Grid-aligned geometry
- Sterile, rectilinear silhouettes
- Soft blue-white analytic lighting bias
- No resonance glow or emotional color bleed

Visually, Han Wei **filters humanity out of the frame**.

---

## FORBIDDEN VISUAL CUES

- No dramatic lighting
- No expressive color saturation
- No personal artifacts
- No signs of fatigue, damage, or collapse
- No visual indicators of inner conflict

He must never look “haunted,” “driven,” or “obsessed.”

---

## COMPARATIVE NOTES

Against Virelli:
- Han Wei appears more technical, less ceremonial
- Less aristocratic presence, more engineered neutrality

Against emotionally expressive characters:
- Han Wei should feel colder, flatter, more controlled
- His danger lies in absence of warmth, not menace
