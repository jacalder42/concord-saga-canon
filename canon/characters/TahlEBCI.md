# TAHL MORGAN — EBCI CANON (Tier-1)

## EBCI ROLE FUNCTION
Tahl Morgan functions as the **mortal truth amplifier** within the Concord Saga.

He is not a combatant, mystic, or leader.  
He is a **signal stabilizer** whose presence increases narrative clarity and systemic pressure.

His EBCI profile governs:
- where he appears
- what modes he drives
- how pressure accumulates around him
- why his survivability fails in Neon

---

## CORE MODE PROFILE

**Primary Modes**
- CIV — Civic / investigative
- SCI — Systems analysis / pattern recognition

**Secondary Modes**
- INT — Quiet interior processing (limited)
- ACT — Only when movement serves investigation

**Forbidden as Primary**
- ROM
- FUN (except incidental bleed)
- HOR (never driven by him)

Tahl does not seek spectacle.  
Spectacle forms **around** his clarity.

---

## CORRIDOR COMPATIBILITY

**Baseline Comfort**
- U1 — Safe
- U2 — Static
- U3 — Pressure

These corridors sharpen his cognition.

**Destabilization Threshold**
- U4 — Memory pressure begins
- U5 — VT sensitivity escalates
- U6 — Unsurvivable for mortal Tahl

**Hard Rule**
Tahl must never *initiate* action in U6+ corridors.  
If present, it is consequence, not choice.

---

## RESONANCE INTERACTION

**MT (Mortal Thread)**
- Always active
- Functions as perception compression, not power
- Improves signal clarity for others
- Does not alter physical outcomes

**VT (VeilThread)**
- Partial, accidental access only
- Triggered by cumulative pressure + proximity
- Produces:
  - perception distortion
  - language thinning
  - temporal compression

**LT**
- Inaccessible
- Echo may interface lightly post-death only (handled elsewhere)

**Hard Separation Rule**
MT ≠ VT ≠ LT at all times.

---

## PRESSURE BEHAVIOR

Pressure accumulates around Tahl via:
- institutional resistance
- narrative suppression
- proximity to shard activity
- moral urgency without relief

Observable effects:
- environmental distortion increases near him
- comms destabilize faster
- crowds polarize more quickly

He is a **pressure lens**, not a generator.

---

## TRILOGY-SPECIFIC EBCI BEHAVIOR

### VEIL
- Peripheral presence
- CIV/SCI dominant
- Low resonance interference
- Identifies early anomalies others dismiss

### NEON
- Central truth carrier
- MT becomes global stabilizer
- Pressure escalates non-linearly
- VT contact occurs late and is fatal
- Dies at Santa Fe rupture (Book 6)

### LOOM
- No mortal presence
- Appears only as echo
- Echo appearances restricted to:
  - clarity thresholds
  - Intent-aligned moments
- Penultimate chapter only (Book 9)

---

## RELATIONAL FIELD EFFECTS

**With Seraphine**
- Lowers emotional noise
- Increases trust corridors
- Allows interruption of his overclocking

**With Lucien**
- Raises structural clarity
- Emotional restraint reinforced

**With Caro**
- Emotional grounding attempts
- Often resisted by Tahl unconsciously

**With Elisabet**
- Shared clarity load
- Reduces cognitive isolation

**With Kade**
- Transfers truth burden
- Establishes successor pressure

---

## FAILURE CONDITIONS (CANONICAL)

Tahl fails when:
- pressure exceeds rest capacity
- VT contact persists beyond threshold
- truth demand outpaces human limits

His death is:
- not punishment
- not destiny
- not sacrifice chosen knowingly

It is **systemic consequence**.

---

## EBCI HARD CONSTRAINTS

- Tahl cannot lead factions
- Cannot stabilize shards
- Cannot manipulate resonance
- Cannot survive prolonged VT exposure
- Cannot return post-death except as echo
- Echo has no agency, only guidance

---

## FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY

Tahl Morgan exists in EBCI terms as:
- the mortal ceiling of truth
- the proof that clarity alone is insufficient
- the hinge between investigation and collapse

His EBCI profile ensures:
truth travels —  
even when the carrier cannot.
