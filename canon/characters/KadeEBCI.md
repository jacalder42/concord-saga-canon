# KADE HARPER — EBCI CANON (Tier-1)

## EBCI ROLE FUNCTION
Kade Harper functions as the **narrative amplifier under pressure** within the Concord Saga.

He is not a stabilizer or architect.  
He is a **force multiplier** whose presence increases emotional amplitude, audience reach, and risk.

His EBCI profile governs:
- where influence accelerates
- how misinterpretation spreads
- why Neon fractures
- how Loom forces restraint and repair

---

## CORE MODE PROFILE

**Primary Modes**
- CIV — Civic speech, public address, testimony
- ACT — Movement driven by urgency (travel, rallies, confrontations)

**Secondary Modes**
- INT — Interior processing (volatile; easily overridden)
- HUM — Earnest connective humor (collapses under guilt)

**Forbidden as Primary**
- SCI — Systems analysis (he lacks discipline here)
- ROM — Never driver
- FUN — Never driver
- HOR — Never driver

Kade drives momentum; others must supply brakes.

---

## CORRIDOR COMPATIBILITY

**Baseline Comfort**
- U1 — Safe (energizes)
- U2 — Static (sparks)
- U3 — Pressure (amplifies)

**Destabilization Threshold**
- U4 — Emotional saturation
- U5 — Narrative runaway risk
- U6 — Unsurvivable without grounding

**Hard Rule**
Kade must not operate alone in U5+ corridors.  
Presence of Seraphine, Caro, Elisabet, or Lucien is required to prevent collapse.

## RESONANCE INTERACTION

**MT (Mortal Thread)**
- Active post-Tahl
- Functions as emotional amplification and distribution
- Converts felt truth into mass narrative
- Does not verify; it *moves*

**VT (VeilThread)**
- No intentional access
- Near-dysregulation under guilt/fear
- Appears as:
  - spiral geometry
  - amplitude spikes
  - language acceleration

**LT**
- Not accessible
- Receives prismatic handshake only in epilogue (no agency)

**Hard Separation Rule**
MT ≠ VT ≠ LT at all times.

---

## PRESSURE BEHAVIOR

Pressure accumulates around Kade via:
- audience growth
- grief exposure
- charismatic validation
- certainty offered by manipulators (Elias)

Observable effects:
- crowd emotion intensifies
- narratives polarize
- stakes escalate faster than facts
- corrective voices get drowned out

Kade is a **weather front**, not a source of order.

---

## TRILOGY-SPECIFIC EBCI BEHAVIOR

### VEIL
- Not present

### NEON
- Emergent voice
- Influence rises faster than judgment
- MT becomes megaphone
- Misinterpretation spreads
- Fracture accelerates

### LOOM
- Central POV
- Nearly weaponized by Brightbreak
- Stopped by Tahl’s echo
- Forced into restraint
- Begins repair through listening

---

## RELATIONAL FIELD EFFECTS

**With Tahl**
- Legacy pressure
- Grief-driven acceleration
- Moral horizon defined by loss

**With Seraphine**
- Emotional grounding
- Interrupts runaway amplification

**With Lucien**
- Structural resistance
- Forces pauses and framing

**With Caro**
- Regulation through humor and honesty
- Prevents collapse via connection

**With Elisabet**
- Clarity injection
- Separates feeling from fact

**With Lacuna**
- Names manipulation
- Interprets narrative predation

---

## FAILURE CONDITIONS (CANONICAL)

Kade fails when:
- certainty replaces curiosity
- influence outpaces care
- grief becomes justification
- narrative eclipses truth

Failure expresses as:
- rhetorical escalation
- moral absolutism
- collateral harm

---

## EBCI HARD CONSTRAINTS

- Kade cannot lead institutions
- Cannot stabilize shards
- Cannot resolve crises alone
- Cannot replace Tahl
- Cannot ascend
- Must relinquish volume to regain integrity
