# CARO — IDENTITY CANON (Tier-1)

## I. Core Identity
- **Name:** Caro
- **Role Function:** action-first stabilizer; care-through-motion axis; kinetic emotional regulator
- **Saga Position:** field anchor within the core ensemble; converts crisis into survivable action
- **Hard Rule:** Caro never replaces emotional processing with force; action is her care language, not avoidance

## II. Geographic Origin
- **Birthplace:** Chicago, Illinois
- **Neighborhood Context:** South Side Chicago (working-class, civic-pressure environment)
- **Emotional Home:** Chicago — motion, urgency, mutual reliance, improvisation under constraint

## III. Cultural Origin / Heritage
- **Heritage:** Mexican American
- **Cultural imprint (compressed):** family-first responsibility; humor under pressure; practical competence valued over abstraction
- **Identity impact:** early normalization of crisis response; care expressed through doing, fixing, and staying present

## IV. Family Structure & Emotional Ecology
- **Family structure:** tight-knit, multi-generational household
- **Primary caregiver influence:** strong maternal presence; responsibility distributed early
- **Sibling context:** present (details vary across source text but consistently responsibility-imprinting)
- **Household dynamic (compressed):** love expressed through action, reliability, and showing up; emotional expression encouraged but never indulgent

## V. Socioeconomic Position
- **Class position:** working-class / lower-middle
- **Institutional proximity:** low; civic-facing rather than protected
- **Primary cost:** early assumption of responsibility; limited margin for failure

## VI. Education / Pre-Saga Trajectory
- **Education route:** community college / trade-adjacent training (paramedic, emergency response, or comparable field experience)
- **Skill identity (compressed):** rapid assessment; physical intervention; emotional grounding through motion
- **Pre-Veil Role:** emergency response / field operations / civic support role

## VII. Psychological Architecture (Identity Loop)
- **Core wound:** if she doesn’t move, people get hurt
- **Core belief:** action prevents loss
- **Stress behaviors:** overextension; delayed rest; prioritizing others’ safety over her own
- **Regulation style:** movement, touch, humor, physical presence

## VIII. Trilogy Anchor Facts (Identity-Relevant)
- **Veil:** reliable action anchor; competence stabilizes crises
- **Neon:** action becomes triage under collapse; cost of endurance accumulates
- **Loom:** action reframed as sustainable care; learns to pace, not just push
- **Post-Mending:** care-through-motion persists but is shared, not solitary

## IX. Ensemble Integration Notes (Identity-Relevant)
- **Seraphine:** grounds bloom through touch and movement
- **Lucien:** challenges over-delay with lived urgency
- **Elisabet:** complements clarity with execution
- **Rex:** shared triage ethic; limits respected mutually
- **Baz:** truth translated into action
- **Trip:** humor and pause provide recovery space

## X. Canon Conflict Ledger (Preserved Record)
- **No active conflicting identity packages** remain in the current Caro source set.
- Variations in exact job titles exist across drafts but converge on action-first civic response; treated as non-conflicting.
