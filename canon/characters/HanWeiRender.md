## RENDER INTENT

Render Han Wei as a figure of **sterile authority and analytical certainty**.

He should read as:
- intelligent
- controlled
- emotionally distant
- procedurally calm

The unease comes from **absence of humanity**, not menace.

---

## COMPOSITION RULES

- Clean, rectilinear composition
- Slightly off-center framing allowed, but balanced
- Upright posture, shoulders neutral
- No dynamic motion or implied action

The image should feel **engineered**, not cinematic.

---

- Minimal shadow contrast
- No dramatic highlights or silhouette effects

Light should suggest **clarity without warmth**.

- Soft steel tones

Avoid:
- warm colors

---

## FACIAL EXPRESSION

- Neutral, analytical expression
- Eyes focused, evaluating rather than engaging

## MATERIAL & TEXTURE

- Matte, technical fabrics
- Smooth, low-texture surfaces
- Minimal visual noise
- No wear, distress, or personal artifacts

Everything should feel **replaceable and standardized**.

---

## STYLE CONSTRAINTS

This is authority through **system design**, not spectacle.
