# ELIAS WARD — APPEARANCE CANON (Tier-1)

## APPEARANCE FUNCTION
Elias Ward’s appearance communicates **credibility, proximity, and plausible authority**.

He must never look:
- theatrical
- extreme
- charismatic in a mythic way
- visibly villain-coded

He should read as:
- competent
- earnest
- slightly worn
- someone people trust quickly

If Elias looks sinister on entry, the design has failed.
