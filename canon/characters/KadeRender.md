# KADE HARPER — RENDER CANON (Tier-1)

## RENDER FUNCTION
Kade Harper’s render profile ensures visual consistency across:
- illustration
- concept art
- covers
- motion tests
- promotional material

He must always read as:
- emotionally charged
- human-scale
- volatile
- non-authoritative

If Kade looks composed, he is being misrendered.

## CANONICAL RENDER STATES

### 1. BASELINE — NEON (EARLY–MID)
**Usage:** Kade’s rise as an MT-adjacent voice

**Visual Read**
- Kinetic, forward-leaning silhouette
- Messy curls in motion
- Expressive posture
- No composure

**Lighting**
- Practical urban light
- Mixed warm/cool contrast
- Environmental spill (street lamps, interiors, overcast)

**Mood**
- Urgent
- Alive
- Unsettled

---

### 2. AMPLIFIED — NEON (LATE)
**Usage:** Narrative runaway phase

**Visual Read**
- Same physical body
- Increased motion blur
- Emotional intensity visible in face and posture

**VFX Constraints**
- Gold-white storm arcs along:
  - curls
  - shoulders
  - forearms
- Spiral geometry appears only at emotional peaks
- No projectile lightning
- No “powers” framing

**Lighting**
- Higher contrast
- Directional rim light
- Background energy, not subject glow

**Hard Rule**
If he looks powerful instead of dangerous, the render is wrong.

---

### 3. FRACTURE — LOOM (EARLY–MID)
**Usage:** Brightbreak manipulation window

**Visual Read**
- Heavier silhouette
- Less bounce, more weight
- Storm energy feels erratic, not expressive

**VFX Constraints**
- Chaotic spiral noise
- Arc jitter without direction
- Visual sense of instability

**Lighting**
- Cooler tones
- Fragmented highlights
- Shadow dominance

**Mood**
- Pressured
- Uncertain
- On the edge of harm

---

### 4. RESTRAINED — LOOM (LATE)
**Usage:** Post-intervention, pre-Mending

**Visual Read**
- Storm energy present but muted
- Movement slows
- Hands more often still

**VFX Constraints**
- Reduced arc intensity
- Geometry aligns instead of flaring
- Energy appears *contained*, not gone

**Lighting**
- Balanced contrast
- Softer edges
- Fewer extremes

---

### 5. POST-MENDING (EPILOGUE ONLY)
**Usage:** Quiet aftermath

**Visual Read**
- Softer presence
- Calm posture
- Stillness earned, not imposed

**VFX Constraints**
- Minimal prismatic lift
- No storm arcs
- No glow

**Mood**
- Responsible
- Grounded
- Listening-forward

This is the **only** phase where Ren’s later integrated energy is valid.

---

## CAMERA & FRAMING RULES

**Preferred Framing**
- Close-medium
- Off-center composition
- Asymmetric balance
- Motion implied or captured

**Avoid**
- Symmetrical hero framing
- Low-angle dominance
- Static center shots

Camera should feel like it’s trying to keep up with him.

## CANONICAL PROMPT PACK

### Portrait — Neon
> wiry young man with messy copper-brown curls, expressive green eyes, forward-leaning posture, layered resopunk clothing, kinetic energy, natural urban lighting, no glow, documentary realism

### Dynamic — Amplified Neon
> emotionally charged figure mid-motion, storm-light arcs tracing curls and shoulders, spiral geometry barely visible, layered denim and canvas, intense expression, cinematic motion blur, no superhero effects

### Loom — Fracture
> storm-energy silhouette destabilizing, chaotic arcs, tense posture, fractured lighting, cool tones, emotional volatility, no control framing

### Loom — Restrained
> same figure with muted storm energy, calmer posture, contained arcs, softer contrast, quiet tension, earned restraint

### Post-Mending
> calm young man with softened curls, neutral clothing, gentle posture, natural light, no effects, grounded presence

---

## NEGATIVE PROMPTS (GLOBAL)

- no lightning attacks  
- no glowing eyes  
- no magical weapons  
- no superhero framing  
- no anime aesthetics  
- no fantasy armor  
- no polished authority poses  

---

## CROSS-MEDIA CONSISTENCY RULE

Across all renders, Kade Harper must:
- look emotionally reachable
- feel like a risk to himself
- never look in control before he earns it

If a render inspires admiration instead of concern, it has failed.
