Tier-1 Antagonist Visual Reference  
Ideological Engineer • Serenity Coercion Architect

---

## PURPOSE

This file defines Saeko Morita’s **visual and physical presentation** for consistency across prose, editorial reference, and potential art generation.

Saeko’s appearance must communicate:
- calm authority without dominance
- gentleness without warmth
- control without force
- care stripped of empathy

She should never appear threatening, dramatic, or overtly powerful.

---

## PHYSICAL PRESENCE

- Still, composed posture
- Minimal physical footprint
- Movements slow, deliberate, and smoothing
- Hands often relaxed or folded, rarely expressive

She occupies space by **reducing motion around her**.

---

## FACIAL & EXPRESSIVE RULES

- Neutral, serene expression
- Soft, unreadable eyes
- Mouth relaxed, rarely expressive
- No visible tension, even under stress

Her face reads as **peaceful**, not kind.

---

## GESTURE & MOVEMENT

- Small, precise gestures
- Movements designed to soothe
- No abrupt motion
- No defensive or aggressive posture

Her body language invites stillness.

---

## WARDROBE LOGIC

### VEIL / EARLY NEON
- Soft, muted fabrics
- Pale neutrals and low-saturation tones
- Simple, modest silhouettes
- Clothing associated with care or wellness spaces

### LATE NEON / LOOM
- Slightly more structured silhouettes
- Same muted palette
- Authority expressed through consistency, not elevation

Her clothing avoids visual hierarchy.

---

## VISUAL SIGNATURE

- Muted color spectrum
- Soft lighting bias
- Reduced contrast
- Minimal geometry, favoring gentle curves

Visually, Saeko **dampens intensity**.

---

## FORBIDDEN VISUAL CUES

- No sharp lines or aggressive tailoring
- No dark, ominous palettes
- No overt symbols or uniforms
- No resonance glow or metaphysical effects
- No visible emotional strain

She must never look menacing.
