# LACUNA — RENDER CANON (Tier-1)

## RENDER FUNCTION
Lacuna’s render profile ensures consistent visualization across:
- illustration
- concept art
- covers
- motion tests
- promotional material

She must always read as:
- human-scale
- fluid
- attentive
- grounding

If Lacuna appears mystical, ceremonial, or authoritative, the render is incorrect.

## CANONICAL RENDER STATES

### 1. BASELINE — VEIL / EARLY NEON
**Usage:** Nightlife, community spaces, early detection scenes

**Visual Read**
- Lithe, mobile silhouette
- Relaxed slouch with alert posture
- Expressive hands in motion
- No glow; no spectacle

**Lighting**
- Practical interiors
- Low, warm ambient light
- Street spill and shadow texture

**Mood**
- Observant
- Playful restraint
- Listening-forward

---

### 2. STABILIZING — NEON
**Usage:** Crowd smoothing, emotional regulation under pressure

**Visual Read**
- Same physical body
- Movement becomes economical and curved
- Presence calms the frame

**VFX Constraints**
- Subtle indigo-violet haze *in the environment*, not as aura
- Gentle motion blur tied to hand movement
- No symbols; no glyphs

**Lighting**
- Indigo side-light
- Soft warm key
- Reduced contrast around her

**Hard Rule**
If she looks powerful instead of steady, the render is wrong.

---

### 3. SUSTAINED PRESSURE — LOOM
**Usage:** Collapse-era grounding, long-duration stress

**Visual Read**
- Slightly heavier posture
- Less flourish, more economy
- Stillness carries weight

**VFX Constraints**
- Haze compresses rather than expands
- Spiral motion appears only in micro-gestures
- Audible hum suggested only through posture/scene context

**Lighting**
- Muted indigo and plum tones
- Soft edges
- Environmental noise dampened near her

**Mood**
- Tired
- Present
- Choosing to stay

---

### 4. RARE INTERPRETATION EVENT (TRILOGY-CAPPED)
**Usage:** At most once per trilogy; extreme pressure only

**Visual Read**
- Same silhouette
- Brief disorientation
- No transformation

**VFX Constraints**
- Momentary alignment of environment (not her body)
- Rhythm syncs, then fractures
- Effect ends quickly

**Cost Indication**
- Post-event withdrawal
- Reduced visual presence afterward

This is not power.
It is information paid for with safety.

---

### 5. POST-MENDING (EPILOGUE ONLY)
**Usage:** Quiet aftermath

**Visual Read**
- Softer posture
- Reduced movement
- Identity intact

**VFX Constraints**
- Minimal prismatic hints at fabric edges
- No haze
- No glow

**Mood**
- Calm
- Attentive
- Unfinished

---

## CAMERA & FRAMING RULES

**Preferred Framing**
- Mid-shot
- Off-center
- Movement captured in frame edges
- Asymmetric balance

**Avoid**
- Centered icon framing
- Low-angle dominance
- Symmetry-heavy compositions
- Static, posed stills

Camera should feel like it’s noticing her, not being addressed by her.

## NEGATIVE PROMPTS (GLOBAL)

- no witch hats
- no occult symbols
- no glowing sigils
- no fantasy robes
- no angelic imagery
- no neon cyberpunk
- no authoritative poses

---

## CROSS-MEDIA CONSISTENCY RULE

Across all renders, Lacuna must:
- look present before powerful
- feel steady before impressive
- remain human at all times

If the image suggests she *controls* the room, it has failed.
