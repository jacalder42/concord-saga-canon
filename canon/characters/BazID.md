# BAZ (BASTIEN “BAZ” ARNAUD) — IDENTITY CANON (Tier-1)

## I. Core Identity
- **Name:** Bastien “Baz” Arnaud
- **Role Function:** diaspora investigator; grounded analyst; Veil Trilogy Lead; human-scale truth witness before resonance becomes legible
- **Saga Position:** truth lineage carrier (**Baz → Tahl → Kade**); ethical stabilizer whose absence reshapes later dynamics
- **Hard Rule:** Baz is truth without performance — he names reality clearly without escalating for impact

## II. Geographic Origin
- **Birthplace:** Marseille, France — multicultural port city with layered identities
- **Neighborhood:** Northern Marseille districts (La Belle de Mai or Le Panier) — immigrant-dense, working-class, high-motion community environment
- **Emotional Home:** Marseille street-level civic reality; port logistics rhythm; lived multicultural negotiation

## III. Cultural Origin / Heritage
- **Cultural identity (source-set):** diaspora port-city French identity with North African family imprint
- **Mother:** French-Algerian cultural codes (bilingual household logic; emotional literacy without sentimentality)
- **Identity impact (compressed):** truth is relational; clarity is civic care; language and translation as power and responsibility

## IV. Family Structure & Emotional Ecology
- **Father:** **Arnaud** — French-born dockworker / port logistics operator; steady, pragmatic, principled; emotionally distant from exhaustion; teaches: “Clarity matters more than victory.”
- **Mother:** **Samira** — French-Algerian nurse / community health worker; warm, protective, strong-willed; bilingual cultural navigation; teaches emotional literacy without softness
- **Sibling:** one younger sister (protective bond; responsibility imprint)
- **Household dynamic:** love expressed through work, responsibility, and steadiness; community proximity; moral clarity formed in civic stress

## V. Socioeconomic Position
- **Class position:** working-class / lower-middle, materially constrained
- **Institutional proximity:** low-to-moderate; civic-facing, not elite-protected
- **Primary cost:** early responsibility; truth-bearing without insulation from consequences

## VI. Education / Pre-Saga Trajectory
- **Education route (source-set):** university track in communications / journalism / investigative sociology (exact major varies in phrasing across source text)
- **Parallel work:** translation, civic mediation, NGO documentation, small investigative collectives
- **Skill identity (compressed):** interviewing; precision listening; triangulation; calm witness presence; grounded empathy without resonance framing

## VII. Psychological Architecture (Identity Loop)
- **Core wound (compressed):** if truth is missed or softened, harm follows
- **Core belief:** clarity carries responsibility; truth is relational, not neutral
- **Stress behaviors:** overwork; refusal to “sell” emotion; isolation after disclosure; stays present while others react
- **Regulation style:** observation → verification → articulation → release; does not perform

## VIII. Trilogy Anchor Facts (Identity-Relevant)
- **Veil:** primary truth engine and POV anchor; exposes hidden systems and institutional contradictions
- **Neon:** absence (or diminished centrality) creates ethical vacuum; truth lineage pressure transfers down the chain
- **Loom:** truth becomes responsibility and record; witness function shifts toward memory and continuity
- **Post-Mending:** civic witness persists as record-keeper / legacy pressure (no metaphysical authority)

## IX. MT / Truth Lineage Notes (Identity-Relevant)
- **Truth lineage:** Baz establishes the human-scale witness cadence later carried by Tahl (MT origin voice) and inherited imperfectly by Kade
- **Hard rule:** Baz never becomes a moral arbiter; his job ends at truth delivered

## X. Canon Conflict Ledger (Preserved Record)
- **No major conflicting identity packages** recorded in the current Baz source set provided in this chat.
