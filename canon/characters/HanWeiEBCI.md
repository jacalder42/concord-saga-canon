# DIRECTOR HAN WEI  
EBCI — Environmental / Behavioral / Corridor Interface  
Tier-1 Technocratic Antagonist

---

## PRIMARY FUNCTION

Han Wei applies **systems pressure**, not personal force.

He exists to:
- reduce human complexity into models
- legitimize emotional suppression as safety
- convert fear into optimization logic
- authorize harm through abstraction

If a scene requires:
- intimidation
- spectacle
- emotional confrontation
- physical violence

Han Wei is the **wrong antagonist**.

---

## ALLOWED MODES

### Dominant Modes
- **SCI** — systems analysis, predictive modeling, data review  
- **INT** — institutional policy, authorization, oversight  

### Secondary / Conditional
- **CIV** — public-facing technocratic authority (rare, scripted)  

### Forbidden
- **ROM**
- **HUM**
- **HOR**
- **SLICE**
- **ACT** (except via delegation or system trigger)

Han Wei does not act directly.  
He **authorizes**.

---

## CORRIDOR COMPATIBILITY

### Native Corridors
- **U1 (Stable)** — optimal  
- **U2 (Static)** — tolerable  
- **U3 (Pressure)** — acceptable if models retain authority  

### Conditional
- **U4 (Memory)** — analytical retrospectives only  

### Forbidden
- **U5–U7**

When resonance exceeds modeling capacity, Han Wei’s power degrades rapidly.

---

## PRESSURE VECTORS (HOW HE ACTS)

Han Wei applies pressure through:

- **Abstraction**
  - converts people into datasets
  - reframes harm as statistical necessity

- **Prediction**
  - justifies preemptive restriction
  - suppresses anomalies before they spread

- **Authorization**
  - signs off on meta programs
  - greenlights emotional suppression frameworks

- **Delegation**
  - harm enacted by systems, not individuals
  - accountability diffused through process

He is most dangerous **one step removed**.

---

## TRILOGY-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR

### VEIL

- Compartmentalizes early resonance data
- Denies unpredictability to global leaders
- Seeds emotional-suppression doctrine

**Failure mode:**  
Early data proves insufficient, but ideology hardens.

---

### NEON

- Greenlights meta programs
- Escalates emotional sterilization frameworks
- Ideological bridge forms to Choirless logic

**Failure mode:**  
Systems succeed locally, fail globally.

---

### LOOM

- Predictive systems collapse
- Models fail under real resonance storms
- Legacy drives panic governance responses

**Failure mode:**  
Reality outpaces optimization.

---

## INTERACTION RULES (KEY RELATIONSHIPS)

### SERAPHINE
- Treated as unmodelable anomaly
- Excluded from systems entirely
- Never engaged as moral authority

---

### LUCIEN
- Respected as intellect
- Condemned for emotional evolution
- Targeted for ideological “correction”

---

### CARO
- Dismissed as anecdotal reliability
- Rejected as non-scalable care

---

### TAHL
- Identified as destabilizing truth vector
- Suppressed via disinformation, not force

---

### KADE
- Initially ignored
- Later flagged as volatile narrative amplifier
- Recognizes Brightbreak manipulation early

---

## FAILURE MODES (HOW HE LOSES)

Han Wei does not collapse emotionally.

He loses when:
- models fail publicly
- systems cause visible harm
- empathy outperforms prediction
- human coordination exceeds optimization

His authority decays through **inaccuracy**, not exposure.

---

## ESCALATION CONSTRAINTS

Han Wei must NEVER:
- appear physically threatening
- engage in emotional argument
- acknowledge moral injury
- act impulsively
- confront protagonists directly

Escalation must occur through:
- tighter models
- broader suppression
- expanded system reach

---

## BEAT-LEVEL USAGE RULE

Use Han Wei in a beat only if:
- harm is indirect but consequential
- decisions are framed as optimization
- stakes are abstracted but real
- protagonists are constrained, not attacked

If a beat requires:
- urgency
- chaos
- violence

Han Wei’s influence may be present,  
but he should be **off-screen**.

---

## CANON SAFETY LOCKS

- Entirely human antagonist
- No metaphysical authority
- No emotional literacy
- No redemption arc
- Harm enacted through systems

Han Wei is the antagonist of logic without empathy.
