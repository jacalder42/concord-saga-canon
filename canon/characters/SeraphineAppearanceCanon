Status: FINAL · MEMORY-ALIGNED · EXPORT SAFE  
Dependency: Seraphine Vael — EBCI Canon

---

## I. PHYSICAL BASELINE (ALWAYS TRUE)

### Height & Build
- Height: **5'5"–5'7"**
- Build: **Soft-athletic**
- Strength distribution: grounded core, strong legs
- Overall impression: capable, warm, steady — never imposing

She reads as physically present rather than dominant.

---

### Skin Tone & Complexion
- Medium-brown skin, often described as *“coffee with a touch of cream”*
- Subtle golden undertones (not yellow)
- Light diffuses softly across her skin rather than reflecting sharply

Her complexion contributes to her calming presence without spectacle.

---

### Facial Structure
- Eyes: warm brown with subtle honey flecks
- Brows: rounded, expressive
- Cheekbones: high but soft-edged
- Jawline: gently tapered, not sharp
- Mouth: soft-full, conveying innate warmth (“resting empathy”)

Her face reads as emotionally open, human, and approachable — not stylized.

---

### Hair
- Texture: **3B–3C natural curls**
- Color: dark brown with sun-softened highlights
- Length: shoulder to upper-back, depending on era
- Environmental response: curls lift and loosen in humidity

Hair behavior is naturalistic and tied to Louisiana climate realism.

---

## II. POSTURE & MOVEMENT GRAMMAR

### Baseline Posture
- Open chest
- Soft shoulders
- Weight evenly distributed
- Subtle protective lean when engaged

She occupies space gently but confidently.

---

### Movement Vocabulary
- Gait: measured, present, quietly confident
- Gestures: open hands, mid-air soft arcs
- Motion is breath-led, not force-driven

She moves like someone used to carrying emotional weight.

---

### Stress Posture
- Shoulders draw inward slightly
- Core tightens
- Breath deepens and slows
- Jaw may set subtly

Stress is visible but controlled.

---

### Grounding Behaviors
- Feet settle before speaking
- Slow exhale
- Slight sway when absorbing tension
- Hands open, palms relaxed

Her body grounds others before her words do.

---

### Forbidden Physical Grammar
- Rigid authoritarian posture
- Sharp, commanding gestures
- Predatory stance
- Militarized movement
- Hyper-melodramatic or theatrical motion

---

## III. WARDROBE & MATERIAL DIALECT

Seraphine’s clothing reflects **Acadiana + Tremé cultural logic** and evolves with pressure.

---

### VEIL ERA (Books 1–3)
- Breathable cotton and linen
- Soft layers with movement
- Warm palette: rust, cream, moss, bayou green
- Light lace or subtle floral accents echoing Creole heritage
- Jeans or skirts that allow ease of motion

She looks approachable, human, and grounded.

---

### NEON ERA (Books 4–6)
- More durable fabrics
- Darker tones due to stress and instability
- Practical jackets
- Hair tied back more frequently
- Clothing feels protective rather than expressive

Her appearance tightens as pressure increases.

---

### LOOM ERA (Books 7–9)
- Storm-rated silhouettes
- Heavier boots
- Practical layering
- Muted greens, browns, deep blues
- Clothing prioritizes responsibility over identity

She looks capable of enduring collapse.

---

### POST-MENDING
- Return to softened fabrics
- Subtle prismatic accents in hems or jewelry
- Silhouettes open again, as if breathing

Nothing ornamental, nothing symbolic-heavy.

---

## IV. RESONANCE, LIGHT & PRESENCE (STRICTLY BOUNDED)

### Baseline Presence
- Warmth reads as emotional, not supernatural
- Subtle diffusion around her in high-emotion moments
- No sharp edges, no strobe effects

---

### Under Strain
- Warm undertones may shift toward soft green → gold
- Light remains diffuse and contained
- Visual cost is visible but never explosive

---

### Bloom / Connection
- Gentle warm-white diffusion
- Expands outward softly
- Requires consent and connection

---

### Post-Mending (Luminous Thread)
- Prismatic drift is **soft and filtered**
- No halo dominance
- No angelic or religious imagery
- Never “glowing” as authority

Her presence connects; it does not command.

---

## V. BEHAVIORAL TELLS & MICRO-ACTING

- Hands open when listening
- Head tilts slightly to signal empathy
- Breath rhythm or faint hum when grounding
- Steps carry natural rhythm, almost musical
- Children and distressed individuals calm near her

These effects are **incidental**, not intentional.

---

## VI. FORBIDDEN VISUAL READINGS (HARD LOCKS)

Seraphine must **never** be visually framed as:
- A saint
- A healer-mage
- A prophet
- A military or institutional authority
- A sci-fi or fantasy archetype
- Sexualized empathy or “soft power” dominance

Soft ≠ weak.  
Warmth ≠ naivety.

---

## VII. ICONIC SILHOUETTE SUMMARY

- Medium-brown skin with warm undertones
- Natural curls responding to humidity and light
- Soft layers that move with her body
- Grounded, open posture
- Diffuse warmth rather than sharp presence

She looks like someone you trust before you know why.
