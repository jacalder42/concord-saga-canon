# REX TAN — IDENTITY CANON v1.1 (Tier-1)

## I. Core Identity
- **Name:** Rex Tan
- **Role Function:** physical-systems stabilizer; constraint engineer; limits-as-care axis
- **Saga Position:** material reality anchor within the core ensemble; enforces what bodies, tech, and environments can actually sustain
- **Hard Rule:** Rex never treats limits as pessimism; constraint is his form of protection, not defeatism

## II. Geographic Origin
- **Birthplace:** Singapore
- **Neighborhood / Early Ecology:** public housing (HDB estate), transit-adjacent, high-density / high-reliability infrastructure
- **Secondary Environment (chosen):** Detroit, Michigan
- **Emotional Home:** places where system stress is visible early enough to be addressed

## III. Cultural Origin / Heritage
- **Ethnicity:** Chinese Singaporean
- **Cultural imprint (compressed):** competence culture without prestige; accountability to systems; intolerance for preventable failure
- **Identity impact:** trust in systems that work; moral rejection of systems that optimize past human limits

## IV. Family Structure & Emotional Ecology
- **Father:** **Tan Wei Ming** — port or transit infrastructure technician; maintenance-focused; reliability as love language
- **Mother:** **Lim Siew Lan** — logistics coordinator / hospital administrative support; preparation and redundancy emphasized
- **Household dynamic (compressed):** non-elite, function-forward; affection expressed through provision, repair, and readiness
- **Foundational imprint:** care equals systems working when people need them

## V. Socioeconomic Position
- **Class position:** working-class → lower-middle
- **Economic profile:** stable within functioning systems; exposed when systems degrade
- **Institutional proximity:** high technical proximity without policy or political authority
- **Primary cost:** emotional labor undervalued relative to performance and output

## VI. Education / Pre-Saga Trajectory
- **Education:** engineering training via competitive national scholarship / industry pipeline
- **Field:** infrastructure / systems engineering (applied, failure-oriented)
- **Merit Pipeline Context:** advancement tied to optimization metrics and reliability benchmarks
- **Pre-Saga Occupation:** systems engineer working on high-reliability civic and tech infrastructure
- **Skill identity (compressed):** diagnostics, load management, failure containment, repair under pressure

## VII. Formative Imprints (Identity-Relevant)
- **Early exposure to functioning infrastructure:** reliability normalized as moral baseline
- **Cascading failure incident:** reveals brittleness created by optimization without empathy
- **Technarch pressure point:** asked to certify a system that succeeds statistically but fails catastrophically for edge cases
- **Ethical breakpoint:** Rex refuses certification quietly and definitively
- **Choice to relocate:** selects Detroit deliberately for its repair-first, failure-visible ecology

## VIII. Psychological Architecture (Identity Loop)
- **Core wound:** when systems fail, people get hurt
- **Core belief:** limits must be respected or catastrophe follows
- **Stress behaviors:** variable over-control; emotional compression; fatigue masked as efficiency
- **Regulation style:** measurement, constraint enforcement, redundancy, stepwise repair

## IX. Authority & Leadership Constraints (LOCKED)
- **Leadership ceiling:** Rex does not command people, movements, or strategy
- **Permitted authority:** technical lead; safety halt; constraint voice
- **Explicit rule:** Rex may slow or stop action on material-safety grounds, but does not set moral or political direction
- **Capability cap:** Rex builds tools that reduce harm; he does not create miracle solutions or total fixes

## X. Trilogy Anchor Facts (Identity-Relevant)
- **Veil:** systems expertise grounds early instability; limits visible before resonance language exists
- **Neon:** Technarch pressure escalates; misuse of certainty exposed; refusal carries personal cost
- **Loom:** fragility zones dominate; constraint ethic becomes survival-critical
- **Post-Mending:** repair culture persists; Rex contributes to resilient, human-scale infrastructure and training

## XI. Canon Conflict Ledger (Preserved Record)
- **Legacy origin package:** Detroit-born Bengali-American variants appear in early drafts; preserved as superseded legacy material
- **Geographic arc variance:** Singapore → Detroit directionality now locked as current canon
- **Employer naming variance:** Technarch / Technarch Directorate treated as the same institutional pressure source
- **Engineering field phrasing:** mechanical / systems / infrastructure used interchangeably; non-conflicting
